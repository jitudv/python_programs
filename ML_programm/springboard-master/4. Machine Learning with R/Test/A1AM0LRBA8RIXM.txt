This is not an easy book to read.Which is exactly why I love it so much.It tantalises the reader to question what is being said, and very few books in the same genre out there manage to do that. The first time I read this book, I couldn't put it down.I found it exciting and alot of what De Mello said, refreshing. I decided to re-read the book again after having it for a year or two and I found it just as exciting, but by the time I had finished the book was thoroughly tired of the De Mello condescending  and patronising tone, which at times was unnecessarily over the top.Nevertheless it doesn't spoil the content of the book, which is brilliant.If you crave a book that will put you on the path to questioning your own reality and sense of being, then this book is a great starting point.
