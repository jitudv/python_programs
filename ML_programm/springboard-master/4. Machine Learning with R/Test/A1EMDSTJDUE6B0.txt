This CD set is fantastic. For qualifications, I have read the trilogy seven times (just started my eighth) over many years. I have listened to nearly every radio play, seen nearly every movie and watched many professional local plays related to it. This BBC production is certainly one of the best.If you like the recent Peter Jackson movie renditions of the trilogy, you will probably like this set as well. They are very similar. This set is more accurate, but it is somewhat understandable that the movie takes more literary license.Yes, like the movie, there are some things taken out (Tom Bombadil, for example). However, this should not be surprising. The unabridged audio version of the trilogy runs something like 55 hours. This set is less than 13 hours - less than 24% of the length! The movies are something like 9 hours, but the visual aspect helps fill in a lot of the details. Although the audio version allows some filling in, too, it obviously does it less so. There are some sound effects that may go unnoticed unless you know the story. This does not detract from the story, but encourages reading it again.One drawback is the dynamic range. Usually, a wide dynamic range like this recording is a good thing. However, when I am driving and listening, I often found myself adjusting the volume so that it was not too quiet or too loud. Sometimes this was a nuisance, but the quality of the audio more than made up for this &quot;deficiency&quot;.Another drawback was the number of tracks and their length. Some of them ranged from 2 minutes to 23 minutes averaging 6 tracks per CD. With it being so easy for a CD to have as many tracks as desired (although 20 is a comfortable maximum because of the displays on some CD players), there was no need for some of the tracks to be so short or so long. This was especially noticeable when the track would shift in the middle of a session or a track would have three or four sessions in one track. The main reason this was a nuisance for me was on my portable CD player. When I turn it off, it does not remember where it stopped (it does remember the track, but some other players do not). So, I would have to remember where I stopped and then fast-forward or rewind for up to 12 minutes.The production itself is excellent. The voices are clear, well articulated and expressive. Each character sounds nearly as well as I imagine they would -- they bring life to the sound waves. The sound editing is excellent. The instrumental music is sparse, but very good. The vocal music ranges from good to excellent and is mostly located at three-quarters of the set and the last CD or so.One test for me is whether the ending makes me cry! Now, I rarely cry at movies, plays, reading books or listening to them. In fact, only three movies have made me really cry (&quot;Greystoke: the Legend of Tarzan&quot;, &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; and &quot;Beaches&quot;) and two books (one of the Sugar Creek Gang books and the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy). When my wife and I read the trilogy outloud together, the last paragraphs took ten to fifteen minutes to complete. This audio set is the same. It is so moving that it is very difficult to keep a stiff upper lip. Like Frodo, I failed. But all's well that ends better!
