A friend at work needed a book to read on the train. I was thinking and thinking and asked him if he liked mysterys. He said &quot;they're ok.&quot; Then I told him to read Agatha Christie's &quot;And Then There were None.&quot; I told him I had read this in seventh grade and still remembered the whole plot; he looked at me like I was some freak. I finally got him to read the book.  If he could figure out who the killer I would pay for the book. He read it and said,&quot;That was the best mystery I've ever read! No wonder you still remember it!&quot; Read this book if you like mysteries! It stuck with me since seventh grade. How well do you remember a book you read sixteen years ago?  Yeah, I thought so.....
