First: I like long books with interesting themes.  I enjoyed getting to know the characters of the previous books (even though I had to refer to a cheat sheet at times to keep them all straight).  BUT:  This book was a nightmare of fog and misdirection.  The introduction of new characters scattered my focus on the plot...oh, that's right, the plot was somewhere in the fog.  I wanted to scream &#34;HODOR&#34; at times.  Will there be some sort of last book that will finally make sense of it all?  One can hope.
