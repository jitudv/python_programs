This novel is mostly about ideas, especially interstellar travel and the role of time and distance. Surprisingly for this genre, some of the characters are well developed and sympathetic. Clarke is able to think through and present many aspects of the planet he presents, and even takes a shot at describing the next planet the ship will visit, and the proposed plan to terraform it. I'm not sure how well all the science ideas will stand careful scrutiny, but it gives a whole lot to think about.
