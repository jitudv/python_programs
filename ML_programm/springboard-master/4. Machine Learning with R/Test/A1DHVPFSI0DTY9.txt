This book turned out to be a revelation to me - it explains so much of History as well as previously obscure Bible stories in an understandable way. It is extremely well researched, and covers ancient history from the time of Moses use of the Ark of the Covenant to the time of King Solomom, to King Herod, to the Knights Templars of the Middle Ages all the way to David Hudson's Modern Day re-discovery of the secrets of monoatomic Gold. I found this book not only informative, but highly enlightening, casting a new light on events described in the Bible. Not only does ancient history look way more exciting than conventional scholars (and churches!) may want you to think, in this book the science behind it is also thoroughly covered and explained. A fascinating read, and I highly recommend it. This should be an important book for times to come - not just for those interested in ancient and Bible History, but also for those looking to the future: it looks like the use of monoatomic elements is the key to fuel cells and the propulsion of the future.
