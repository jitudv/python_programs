This is the second book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This book continues the journey of the fellowship. Their task is to destroy the ring of power. Unfortunately, the fellowship is broken up. The hobbits, Frodo and Sam, continue on towards Mount Doom. The rest of the group race to save Merry and Pippin, who have been captured by Sauruman's troops.This book races through events and follows the two groups as the story unfolds. Where will the fellowship find help? Can Gollum be trusted? We are introduced to the people of Rowhan, Gondor and the wonderful Ents. We witness the first great battles of the war (at Isengard and Helm's Deep). We can feel the tension increase as the hobbits get closer to their goal. However, the closer they get, the harder and harder the road becomes. It is similar to a wave cresting right before crashing into the rocks.This book continues the wonderous tale of the ring. Tolkien's life long work on Middle Earth comes to fruition in these books. Tolkien's focus on the details that back up the story and myths of Middle Earth reaps tremendous rewards to the reader. It is a great read!
