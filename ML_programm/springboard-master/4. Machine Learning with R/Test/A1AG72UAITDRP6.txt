Where does one begin?  To judge near perfection, all the while striving to place words in such a manner to draw the yet unchanged masses into our shared love affair, such a task is beyond my means, but my love for this  glorious tale drives me to make an effort despite the fact.It is with  great regret that I admit waiting until my twenty-fifth year to have read  this literary masterpiece, and having claimed to be enamored with  fantasy-fiction.  Heresy, that's what it was, to have avoided this grand  tale in favor of lesser offerings when only my memories of that foul and  near blasphemous animated film version drove me away.  I am driven to  shame.I will refrain from illuminating the history of the story, and its  author, as the information is available so readily in the "Editorial  Reviews" portion of this page.  Instead, I fear my review will remain in  the realm of the subjective, as opposed to an unbiased intellectual appeal;  sorry the story simply touches to deep for such a callous approach.  However, I would like to suggest that if you decide to purchase this  magnificent tale, I highly recommend the "Houghton Mifflin Co." edition,  released in June 1999, an edition which claims to be the most accurate copy  to date.  More importantly, it is said Tolkien intended the three works:  "The Fellowship of the Ring", "The Two Towers", and "The Return of the  King" to be considered one work, not a trilogy as we have come to know  them.  Having the three divisions in one binding reinforces the continuity  of the tale as a whole, and I felt it greatly increased my veraciousness to  devour each skillfully placed word.I am loath to reveal even the most  innocent and seemingly innocuous detail about the tale, for fear, my words  could steal any of the joy you find while reading Tolkien's words.  Yet,  you should understand that the tale follows in the days after "The Hobbit",  and that the meager forces of light must fight the insurmountable shadow of  evil.  An age is coming to an end and with it the wonder and majesty of  Middle-Earth.  If you have yet to read "The Hobbit", do so first for it  sows the seeds, which the "Lord of the Rings" skillfully harvests.  Tolkien's opus is, and will always remain a seminal work of our age, a  title none can afford deny themselves.The author's gentle, but sweeping  touch resounds with a love for his creation.  The fullness of the  characters, and of the lands in which they live and die are so three  dimensional, so very tangible and full of vitality that it is nearly  impossible to refrain from growing emotionally involved.  Even the villains  are well developed.  Through dialogue and narration we become aware of  their motivations, giving renewed depth to the story and its events.Even now, this masterwork is being translated to the silver screen (a  trilogy by "New Line Cinema"); read it now before you see the films, do not  deny yourselves the true wonder of Tolkien's mastery.
