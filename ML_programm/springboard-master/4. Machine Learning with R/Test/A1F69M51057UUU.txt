I just finished DoD and I truly feel like it was a waste of time. I loved the first 3 books, thankfully I read the reviews about a Feast of Crows and wasn't too disappointed  by the fact that a lot of the characters I had invested in were no where in the book. I also read the reviews for this book, and bought it, and skimmed, skimmed, skimmed - oh read about Theon, skimmed, skimmed, read a bit about Arya, skimmed over all the useless filler, no forward moving dialogue- ugh just boring! What happened? How could the first 3 books be SO GOOD, and the last 2 so poor?
