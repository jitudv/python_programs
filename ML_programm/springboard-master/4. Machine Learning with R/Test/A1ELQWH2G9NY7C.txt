I listened to the audio book that I received from a friend and I really enjoyed it. There were times that it was a bit drawn out and certain things just seemed unnecessary and unimportant but over all I did enjoy it and will continue to read the series. I just wish the ebooks were cheaper, I know I can find this book online for less then five dollars used.
