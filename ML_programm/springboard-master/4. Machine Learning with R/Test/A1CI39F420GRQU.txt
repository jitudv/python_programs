I did not know much about the Mid East conflict till I picked up this book. Ignorantly, I assumed that the crux of the matter was the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which had arisen after the mass migration of Jews to Jerusalem after WWII and the founding of a modern Jewish state in 1948. Of course this is an important contribution to the problems in the Mid East, but Friedman's book brought out the other players in the conflict and how the  underlying (though not all that subtle sometimes) manipulation of the other nations in the region were crucial in aggravating an already troublesome political and religious situation. I was hooked to the book from page one and the introduction and historical background Friedman gives to the Mid East and the continual unresolved conflict provides ignoramuses like myself a good foundation from which to better comprehend Mid Eastern politics and culture. I wouldn't say I am an expert on Mid East now, but Friedman's book has definitely given me some basic knowledge and I can now look more closely and explore deeper into subjects which interest me in the Mid East. Informative, and engaging, Friedman's book is required reading for anyone interested in the complexities of the Middle East.
