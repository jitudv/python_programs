I purchased this book some years ago to read during a long car ride because the book was long, and I am a fan of historical fiction (and non-fiction too, for that matter.)I was pleasantly surprised. The book is well-written, engaging, reasonably fast-paced, and I didn't notice any jarring anachronisms or inaccuracies of the sort that usually ruin historical fiction. The story is interesting, to boot, although I was not especially gripped by the love-story aspect.Having not had the privilege yet of reading any Jean Plaidy, the closest author I can compare this to is Sharon Kay Penman, and I have to say that if you like Penman, Gregory's THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL will not disappoint you.
