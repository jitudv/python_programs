...and then drops you like a hot potato. I was riveted by Ethan's wonderful way with dialogue and character development and so I'm naturally waiting for some sort of intense, raw ending and then boom, it's over with a thud. Why Mr. Hawke chickened out at the end I'm not sure. Still, I recommend reading this book if only to get a taste for his writing style which is really great, he just needs to figure out how not to drop the ball at the finish line.
