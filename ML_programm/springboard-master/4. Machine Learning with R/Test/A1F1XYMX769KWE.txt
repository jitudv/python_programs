I love world-building, and this is an excellent world. Five sentient races, each of whom is very different from each other, with difficulties in reconciling such and working together.This book (while it read as a stand-alone, there are apparently others set in the world) focuses on the relationships between the humans and the harpies. Some humans hate them; some worship them. What happens when these collide? The harpies are well-drawn, though- and this might be a spoiler- in the end it looks like they are using their worshippers as dupes.Ki isn't having any of that, given her experiences. Though- her choices were ambiguous; she clung to memories even when they were hurting her. The plot was well-crafted to show character growth, and her tentative transition between mourning the past and having a future. Other characters also grew and changed.The plot and pacing were excellent., handled by a series of flips between the current situation and flashbacks- but very well-handled.I am pleased to see there are more in this series, because this one read like a stand-alone novel; no cliffhangers, and the plot threads were resolved. Still, the world and the writing are fascinating enough that I look forward to reading more.Triggers: some serious violence, but nothing rapey.
