This is the first paullina Simons book I have read so I can't compare it to her other books. I did really like this one though. At first it was a little confusing and at times overwhelming with all the different characters and story lines going on, and it did take quite a while to get into. But once I did get into it, it became hard to put the book down. The beauty of following so many story lines is that you'll be interested in Atleast 1, if not them all. I found this book to be creative and unpredictable. The characters were really relatable and lily was particularly likeable. I like how the storylines all came together at the end and interrelated. In saying all of this, I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers about the whole lotto ticket not being cashed straightaway as highly ridiculous and frustrating. With all that said I do recommend this book, it's a good read in my opinion. And I never say that lightly!
