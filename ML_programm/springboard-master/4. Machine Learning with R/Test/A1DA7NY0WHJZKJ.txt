This book is extremely well written.  It explores a subject most people know little if anything about and while it is clearly fiction, the historical references are so authentic, you forget that at times.  It's not a quick read, being over 400 pages, but it holds the readers interest.  If you like history, or romance or are an anglophile, you'll enjoy this book.
