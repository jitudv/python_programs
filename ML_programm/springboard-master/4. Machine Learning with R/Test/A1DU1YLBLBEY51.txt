The first time I read Lord of the Rings as a child I liked it.  Nice poems, cool chase through Mordor and Saruman, Gollum and the Ents were pretty nifty.Look, all you writers out there: All fantasy books don't have to be set in some pseudo-medieval European setting where everyone is remarkably clean, healthy and odor-free despite a distinct lack of basic sanitation devices.I acknowledge that this book was revolutionary forty years ago, but the world has changed since then and our writing could stand to reflect that.Not that Lord of the Rings is a bad book-- it's not-- but not everything about it is so unquestionably wonderful.First off: The ending sucks.  I still haven't figured out what Haven is meant to be, (Heaven?) and why Frodo and the elves had to go there.  What? Is it that they were too good for our world.  If so then that is really lame.Second: The unquestioning faith Tolkien places in the superiority of high birth and the unfailing belief in a rigid class system, (something which I am surprised to see most modern readers simply don't notice) was old fashioned and retrograde even in his own time.  I mean why should Strider/Aragorn be automatically made king? How come no one questions this? The idea that without the true blue-blood king the land would falter is ridiculous.  Whatever happened to democracy?  This odd yearning for the old class system can be seen in Sam's servile obedience to Frodo and Frodo's servility to Aragorn, the Elves and other high born humans.4. How did Gandalf get out of the pit in the mines?  No explanation in either the books or the movies.5.  Pure good vs. Pure Evil: There are reasons why Saruman and Gollum are the best characters in the books.  They're the most like real people, with multiple facets and real motivations for their deeds.  I mean what's Sauron's deal?  He's a big flaming eye of pure evil.  Not much characterization there.  And the Orcs-- probably the worst scene in the book is when Gimli and Legolas brag to each other about how many Orcs they each have killed and this goes on without the disapproval of any character.  Yeah, lets see all our enemies at war as subhumans agents of pure evil, right. This is a complete cheat.  If ever we needed to hear the message that those we fight on the battlefield are people just like us, with families, desires and loved ones-- now is the time.  How convient that Orcs are created out of mud and have no little Orc children to mourn them when they fall to serve as another notch on Gimili's belt.5.  In the same line of thinking the character development is lacking-- characters like STrider, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir and others seem remote and unhuman.While I understand that Tolkien sought to copy the episodic style, characterization and epic tone common to such early Northern European myths as Beouwulf, for modern readers not to see the faults inherit in these forms is to be ignorant.
