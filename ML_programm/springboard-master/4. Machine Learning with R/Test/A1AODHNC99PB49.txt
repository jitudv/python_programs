This book is going to join my other top five in my cabinet. The author's carefully crafted country and history serve to draw you in and ground you in the world--and before you know it, you're right there alongside Tobin, imagining all &quot;he&quot; has to deal with when his secret is a secret no more. I can't wait for the sequel! Please hurry Lynn :-)
