This is a quick and easy read. I gobbled it up happily in one sitting, because it was very quick to grab my attention, and once it was grabbed, it held me till the very end.  I don't need to and I won't tell the plot line of this story...read the blurb above.  Once again, Sheldon like the true magician he is, pulls the rabbit out of the hat in a way only he can, when you least expect it. Just when you think there couldn't be any more surprises, the story veers off into a new and unexpected direction. That's what makes Sidney Sheldon, Sidney Sheldon! Cute details that most readers will probably not have been aware.1) The principal in Kemal's school, Vera Kostoff, is obviously a homage to Sheldon's wife Alexandra, (n&eacute;e Kostoff) 2) The character of Anastasia Mann is Alexandra's sister in real life. 3) Rowana Trott I believe is his niece. (I must check on that) 4) Armand Deutsch worked alongside Sheldon when he was working for MGM.I believe that's all there is. I think it's a cute way to pay tribute to people who influenced his life.This wasn't a classic like Master of the Game (and a novel of that caliber I believe will be VERY hard to reach) but, nevertheless it was compulsively readable, and just to contradict the nay-sayers: &quot;Predictable? This is anything BUT predictable!&quot;I now eagerly await for more! Will we see Dana, Jeff and Kemal again? Give us more, sir! Keep up the good work!!!
