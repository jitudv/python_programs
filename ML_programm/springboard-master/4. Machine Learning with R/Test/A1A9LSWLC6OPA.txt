This is the ultimate audio production of The Lord of the Rings with an absolutely stellar cast, music and sound effects. I got a big kick out of the fact that Ian Holm played Frodo in this production and played the aged Bilbo in the more recent movies! The character development is stunning--pay attention to how Strider/Aragorn's speech changes as the story progresses. To me, the recent movie trilogy falls very short of what I picture as I listen to this production--it is one of the best radio productions I have ever heard!
