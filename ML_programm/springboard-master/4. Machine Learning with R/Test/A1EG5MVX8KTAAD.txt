Yes, it is THAT good.  I must say that so far this is my favorite read of the summer.  I didn't know what to expect, the concept of a common history told by an uncommon character (Anne Boleyn's sister Mary) is touchy.But I loved it, for Gregory not only writes well, but she has quite an imagination.  I was impressed and intrigued by the way she took a history known to many, many people (we all know Anne's fate here) and made it fresh with murder and tons of dark little Boleyn family secrets. Mary, Anne's younger, obedient to the end, golden sister tells the tale of how the family gave, risked, and gambled everything, often at too high a price, to put Anne in the King's bed and ultimately on to the throne.And I also love the way she has made Anne Boleyn out to be a complete monster in this novel, when she did meet her fate I have to say that I didn't feel too bad for her.A must read for anyone who is looking for a great story!
