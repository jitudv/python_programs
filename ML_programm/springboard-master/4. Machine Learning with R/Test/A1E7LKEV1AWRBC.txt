I read a lot.  I read a lot of fiction, non fiction, classics, literature, manuals, blah, blah, blah.  I own thousands of books.  when i was younger I would read a book through no matter how bad, as I have gotten older and had more demands on my time, I've realised the folly in this so gladly toss aside a book that is worthless and shun authors who have disappointed me too often.I might read Winds of Winter if it comes out and if I have not decided to read something else at the time.  I enjoyed a Game a Thrones and a Clash of Kings and a Storm of Swords.  I slogged through Feast but could not re-read it.  I struggled through Dance and will not waste time re-reading it.  I could give a synopsis of this 959 page book in less than 5000 words and none of them would be used describing the menu or the wine or the beer.This series suffers from the lack of a decent editor who would look at the pages and cut them by 75% and tell Martin to tighten things up, to get to the story, to dispense with tricks and cliff hangers and, again, get to the story.Feast showed us the story had gotten away from Martin.  Dance shows us he is still not sure what to do, where to go, how to proceed.  Both Feast and Dance could have been combined, as was originally planned, into one book and that book could have been less than 500 pages and we would have cried out for more rather than plodding through a tired replay of feasts and argument and schemes we've seen many too many times before.A good editor would have kept Martin focused on the story but editors lose the spine when an author becomes popular and they let any old POS get published as long as there is a ready audience to snap it up and cry for more.I came to the series late.  I got Game and Clash for $4 as single book.  I bought Storm for $6ish, I believe I paid $12ish for Feast and I pro-ordered Dance for around $15.  My initial $10 investment was sound.  My later $27 was not.Others have said, nothing happens in this book.  I disagree.  We get about 100 pages of story.  The problem is that there are 959 pages in the book and teasing the story from these pages is tiresome work.
