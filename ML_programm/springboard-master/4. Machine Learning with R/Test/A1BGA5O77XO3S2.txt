What a wonderful adaptation of the Professor's translation of the Red Book! I did not care for Arwen's voice, but otherwise the entire cast is wonderful, just as they were in the films, but I think this is even better than those magnificent productions, truer to life. Ian Holm is superior as Frodo, going from innocent, carefree lad excited about seeing Gandalf's fireworks to one completely broken and in despair. You get the feeling this is what it was really like for him, the pain, the suffering, the fears and the tears, the horrific cost to his heart and soul to be Ring-bearer and carry his cross to Mount Doom. Reading that the Nazgul were pressuring him to put on the Ring is one thing. To actually hear them saying "Put on the Ring, put on the Ring," and hear Frodo struggle against it and not always win is quite another. To read that he lashed out at Sam in the tower while under the influence of the Ring is nothing compared to hearing that meltdown and his retelling in tears of how the orcs had abused him and how he wished the Ring had never come to him. That he suffered during his anniversary illnesses is brought out heartbreakingly well.  He's got an incredible voice and range of feelings in this broadcast. Aragorn/Strider has a very calm, soothing voice that is needed for four frightened hobbits to hear and it's clear he cares deeply for them. Smeagol/Gollum is one completely cracked hobbit and that is played very well.  The music, though limited, is very good, especially the lovely "Bilbo's Last Song" at the end. I could go on and on. I've listened to it repeatedly. So should you!
