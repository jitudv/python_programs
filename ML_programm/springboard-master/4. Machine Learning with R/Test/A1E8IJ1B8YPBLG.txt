Eight Days of Luke was definitely a fun book to read. As usual, Ms. Jones has used much of her creativity in this book. She has strongly portrayed characters: David, a true cricket fan; Luke, mischief-maker; cranky Aunt Dot; frugal Cousin Ronald; the list goes on. Each character seems to play off one another, making the book almost seem like a live play unfolding before you.Ms. Jones has also incorporated some of her wit into this book. I was laughing out loud at some of the jokes. She also does a good job of making you feel the emotions of the characters.The absolute best part of this book is the twists and turns of the plot. Everything about this book is unusual and unique, which made me love it all the more. The story is constantly moving - there isn't a spot where the storyline slows down and lags. The conclusion was amazing; I was glued to the book trying to read faster and faster to see what would happen to David and Luke and Astrid. By the end, all the elements of plot fit together, like an intricate and well-made puzzle.I highly recommend this book to all age groups. There is something in here for everyone. Brava, Ms. Jones!(If you want a synopsis of this book, look above. Amazon.com does a great job of telling you the storyline.)
