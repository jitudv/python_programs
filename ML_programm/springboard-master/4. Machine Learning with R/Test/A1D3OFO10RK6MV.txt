While being another solid entry in this series its not my favorite.  Some of the dramas, especially the dragon lady's, are starting to get a bit tired with how long they are dragging on and how the characters continue to make the same mistakes constantly.  That being said there are some good chunks of high adventure, great plot thickenings all over, and exciting answers are provided along with the inevitable MORE questions that make you really hate how long these books take to release.  If you are a fan of the series this is totally worth buying.
