What a concept: a fantasy series that doesn't involve a feckless young pig  farmer, a grizzled old wizard, or a wry thief who's actually a nobleman.  Hobb's characters are fascinating, multi-dimensional people from a variety  of cultures (including one memorable non-human tribe). Their adventures and  misadventures bring up larger issues of power, feminism, and slavery--but  these themes are carefully explored, not driven home with a hatchet. Hobb  is also among the best prose stylists writing modern popular fantasy, and  the pages melt away as the plot grows thicker.
