ALONG CAME A SPIDER by James Patterson.The plot, the events, and actions were very well done.  I was surprised and pleased.  The book definitely kept my interest.  The main reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn't smile.  I think of Grisham who takes me to the 5 star level.  He writes a similar genre, but he makes me smile, either at the intriguing characters, or the "wow that is so exciting" when being chased or trapped or wondering if the hero will survive.At times I felt impatient to get some answers.  The result was it felt a little slow.  I've read other police procedural mysteries that had me less impatient and enjoying the journey more.The narrator Charles Turner was fine, but I wish Morgan Freeman had narrated.  The character Alex Cross is a black man from the south.  Morgan played Alex in the movie, and I kept thinking about him.  He would have been a great narrator.The story is told in first person from Alex's point of view and then third person for other characters and events.  That structure worked ok, but I would have preferred third person for all.  When he switches to first person, I am almost taken out of the story, thinking of myself - my perspective.DATA:Unabridged audiobook reading time: 12 hrs and 21 mins.  Violence: strong.
