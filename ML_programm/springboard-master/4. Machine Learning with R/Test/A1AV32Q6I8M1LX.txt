If this had been an early work by a writer, it would have ranked pretty decently.However, coming from Jack Higgins, writer of The Eagle Has Landed and other exciting books, this book is a pathetic rehash of worn-out formula, reusing Sean Dillon in its umpteenth time as a nemesis operating outside legal jurisdiction.The premise was very simple, and almost like the last several Sean Dillon's novel.  The ex-wife of Blake Johnson was murdered for trying to expose Jack Fox, a new generation of Mafia don in America.  Blake Johnson was a personal friend of the US President as well as the head of the Basement, a clandestine US agency which answered only to the president.  Clandestine my foot, Jack Fox easily got a gambling addict of a computer don to hack into government computers and found out all about Blake and the Basement, and no warning was triggered in one of the supposedly most secure computer systems in the world of intrusion.Deciding to strip everything away from Jack Fox before killing him, Jake learned through the assistance of British G4 - Ferguson, Sean Dillon, Hannah Bernstein & recently added temp member hacker whiz Roper - that Jack Fox needed to snag several big illegal deals in Europe & Middle East to make good the financial losses he incurred in legitimate businesses.What followed was a series of computer arcade style of shoot, bomb and destroy mission, with Dillon & Johnson targetting every one of Jack Fox's illegal business deals outside the Mafia.Readers would get no kick as the heroes blast their way across from New York to London to Lebanon to Ireland.  The villains did absolutely nothing to counter Dillon and Johnson, except for a few minor attempts at reprisal.  Not even the flash-forward in chapter one whereby Johnson was captured and brought to Hellsmouth did anything to increase the excitement.Higgins made a pathetic attempt to add dramatic tension by Hannah Bernstein's moral delimna of her boss Ferguson and her colleague Dillon's impunity at operating outside the law, and add another female gunner to balance her.  However, these fizzled to nothing than a few phrases to state she felt upset.On the whole, there was nothing added to the recurring characters and the villain Jack Fox who was supposed to be a Desert Storm veteran played mafia like a backyard bully - and was even derided by Dillon and Roper as not lasting a minute in Belfast.This book may suit those into the shooting arcade game culture, but nothing more.
