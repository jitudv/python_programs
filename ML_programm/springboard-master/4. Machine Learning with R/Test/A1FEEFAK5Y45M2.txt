While the concept is quite fascinating, the actual &quot;adventure&quot; is somewhat boring and uneventful.  Not that I need loss of life or violent hurricanes for excitement, but a &quot;major event&quot; was the daily  circling of dolphins, which Heyerdahl calls to our attention at least ten  times.  This alone attests to the opinion that the book is not organized or  written well.  It is a loosely conected batch of ramblings.  Perhaps some  of the power was lost in the translation, but in general, the story rates  right up there with my 3rd grade narrative on my summer vacation.
