Jhumpa Lahiri describes the immigrant experience better than any writer I know.  Her first effort, a collection of short stories, "Interpreter of Maladies",  was wonderful.  I read The Namesake as a short story ("Gogol"  in The New Yorker Magazine.  I have to conclude that it was more effective in an abbreviated form than as a full length novel.  I became bored with her lengthy descriptions of affluent upscale lives of Ivy League professionals.  Although I get her point about the emptiness of it all, I think it went on too long.  Still, the story held together and I could understand why the death of Gogol's father caused him to return to his Bengali roots and find new meaning in the customs and culture and his connectedness to his family.  While a quick  and enjoyable book to read, when it was over, I scarcely thought about it again.
