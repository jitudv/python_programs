This book is a HUGE disappointment.  The characters were totally unbelievable.  The horses were more real than the people.  I kept waiting for it to get better and before I knew it...I was done.  LAME ending.  Don't waste your precious reading time with this one.  IF you liked Jane Smiley's Thousand Acres, you will hate Barn Blind.  YUK!
