I did not realize what a wonderful job that Ingles had done in this reading until I began listening to other audio books. Ingles manages to give each character a distinct voice and as you proceed, you recognize immediately who it is that is speaking.After many years, Tolkien's work stands alone as the only sci-fi/fantasy story that puts the subtlety of language and culture equal to, if not above, the drama. Ingles interesting voices and care with the language of Tolkien make this a most worthy represenation of the timeless classic.
