Ms. Lahiri is great at describing a room, food, and one's inner chatter.  Very nice narrative.  You can picture her sitting in a room and typing a detailed description of the couch, the drapes, the walls -- but this is not very good writing if that's all there is and pretty much that is as good as it gets.  She does a nice job of capturing immigrant and first-generation American angst and how Americans can be culturally insensitive, but it seems tired and whiny rather than engaging.There's nothing much going on in this novel.  Even when the reader approaches the upcoming climax of the story and she teases the reader into thinking finally there will be some conflict, some emotion, some drama, some dialogue... the author just drops it, moves on to a sort of epilogue and backstories and narrates the would-be climax which diminishes it further. It's as if she's afraid to have her characters really face each other.  The important scenes seem hidden.Which is not surprising, given the protagonist, Gogol Ganguli. He is a passive, bored and boring person who never grows, never learns anything about life, always sees the cloud in every silver lining.  He is ashamed of his Indian background, takes no joy in things American or anything else in his upscale yuppie life.  He never leads life, he lets life lead him.  So others are always calling the shots.  This might work if he finally took charge of his life in the end, but even that doesn't change. Why should we care much about this man?The author milks the title, regarding how Gogol got his name, for all its worth and much too much more, which further drags the story.  Like the climax, this sub-plot gives the reader anticipation of bigger things, but there's no there there.  It just peters out into descriptive depression like most of the setups in the book.
