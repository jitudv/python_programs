These books are simply gorgeous. They are top-quality, with glossy paper and come in a very sturdy box. However, they books are a LOT larger and heavier than I expected, which is fine, but would definitely make reading them difficult. It would be a burden to have to carry them around, as each individual book is surprisingly heavy. However, they are great collector's items, meant to last. I bought them because they look nice, and I wanted to own a better copy of this magnificent series other than my old beaten up paperback editions. (I will still use the paperbacks for re-reading, though!)Even so, they are wonderful copies, and I highly recommend them if you are looking for a nice edition to collect or display. I think it would have been better if they made these books more practical, though, as nice as they are.
