Ok, let's give Ethan Hawke a break here.  Like most authors, his first writing effort left something to be desired.  However, given a bit more time and experience, I think he would really improve.The Hottest State is a short novel, from a male point of view.  It's about his falling in love and getting his heart broken.  It's about his absentee father and his trying to cope with this most of his life.  It's about a 20 year old, turning 21 and trying to figure out what to do with his life.After finishing the book, I was left a little bad taste in my mouth.  The book wasn't quite what I thought it would be, or could be.  And the ending was a bit odd.  However, I did enjoy much of the story and the characters.  Even though the characters did get on my nerves at times...I'm not decided yet about reading his next book, but I've heard it's better, so I'll probably give it a try!
