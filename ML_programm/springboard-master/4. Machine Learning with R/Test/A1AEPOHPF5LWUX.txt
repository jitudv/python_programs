This audio CD does not do justice at all to the story. Every man portrayed sounds like a pirate with a bad cold, and about 70 years old regardless of the age of the character.  If the voice is not an old phlegmy pirate it is the voice of a dumb cockney street urchin. Dotrice robs the female characters of all depth and meaning. I have listened to all the audio books of this series and all suffer, but this is by far the worst. A new reader for this series is badly needed.As far as the book itself, I confess I want to see this story to the end but this is way to dragged out and slow. The book plods along interspersed with important and or exciting events only rarely. Could be so much better. Perhaps I will take the HBO route instead.
