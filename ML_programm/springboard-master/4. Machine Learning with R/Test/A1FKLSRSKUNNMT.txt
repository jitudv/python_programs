Clancy's great gift as a writer has always been his ability to tell a good  story, and he does a fair job with this one.  However, this isn't a great  story, and it's not very well written.  Although the concept is quite  interesting, Clancy's writing fails in two critical areas: characters and  continuity.  His characters are generally simple and one-sided: the  villains are easy to hate, and the heros are easy to love.  Nobody wears a  hat, but you get the idea nonetheless.  Other than the characters that  Clancy has developed over multiple books, there isn't anyone here who  really feels quite real.  Clancy fans will still root for Jack Ryan and  John Clark, but they don't really have much competition here.  As for  continuity, Clancy loves to pack his novels with subplots, which can be a  good thing, but here he apparently bit off more than he could chew, as one  subplot is rather arbitrarily cut off.  Losing it does not hurt the book,  but if he wasn't going to use, Clancy could have improved the book by  simply omitting it entirely.  Overall, the novel offers an interesting look  inside a fictional presidency and is a fun read, but little more.
