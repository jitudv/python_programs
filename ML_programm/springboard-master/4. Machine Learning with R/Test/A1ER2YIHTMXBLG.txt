This is hard to write mostly because I had such high hopes for this book.  Many reviews were wonderful.  And, goodness knows Hobb's Assassin trilogy predecessors were worth a full five stars each.  This first book in the Liveship Traders series just did not click so-to-speak.  Maybe it was the hundred or so pages of waiting for a character's death (a character I honestly liked that plays no part other than dying) that starts the book that turned me off (don't worry, I'm not giving away anything important here, not a spoiler).The character development is good in that all characters are all self motivated.  However, many of the characters are not enjoyable to read about which at times makes the book seem very long indeed.Clearly Hobb wants us to embrace Althea (our heroine), Brashen, Wintrow, and of course Vivacia herself.  I like Althea.  Really I do, but she just doesn't keep me interested (insert here: like Fitz Chivalry Farseer did).  Brashen is interesting and I think I'll like him more in the next book.  Vivacia is wonderful to read about.  I wish Wintrow would just go away.  Here is a problem since so many chapters revolve around him and I really could care less about him and his complete inability to be what he needs to be.On the other hand not all of our villains are all that bad (again, true self-motivation and believable characterization - Hobb's strength).  Kyle Haven is such an ass.  Ok, he's trying to do what he believes is right ... but he can't see the forest for the trees.  Kennit is respected by many but such a complete idiot - I hope Hobb kills him off soon.  Kennit's [prostitue] however is so engaging that I hope she becomes a major character in the series.  Of all the characters, she has the most potential.  Malta ... someone please spank this whiny little brat and put her to bed without any supper before she messes up everything.  I don't hate her ... I frankly just don't want to read about her ... ever.Filler characters that SHOULD be more:  Ronica never comes into her own and she should have started off as a strong matriarch ... not a weenie.  Keffria is completely useless and I hope she goes away soon.Storyline / Plot is well thought out and definitely worth the time it takes to read it.The Rain wild traders are intriguing and promise much in the future.The Serpents promise many twists in the plot and I'm looking forward to hearing more about them as the series progresses.So, overall:  Character development is good in that they are all self-motivated but many of the characters are not enjoyable to read about which at times makes the book seem very long indeed.  Storyline / Plot is well thought out and definitely worth the time it takes to read it.
