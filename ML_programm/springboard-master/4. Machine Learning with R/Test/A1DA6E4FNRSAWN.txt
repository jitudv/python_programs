(I am not a native speaker, please overlook my style)I am not going to review the novel, the root and basis of modern fantasy, a novel I simply love, even if I am not entirely blind to some of its flaws.This edition was quite a disappointment to me: I bought it to have a nice collectible edition of this classic and was sadly disappointed: the box and the over bookcover are lovely, the pictures are exquisite but the binding is very  poor in quality; poor as it is, it is still better than the paper used and the printing which are untolerable for an edition as expensive as this.If you are looking for an edition for your library, chose elsewhere.
