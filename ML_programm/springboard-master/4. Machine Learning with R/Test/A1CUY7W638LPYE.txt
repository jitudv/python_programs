These stories range from bizarre (The Exiles, The Fire Balloons) to thought-provoking (The Veldt, The Man, Marionettes, Inc., The Last Night of the World) to downright depressing (The Highway, The Long Rain, The Rocket Man, The City, Zero Hour).  There is a common whimsical element in all the stories that I found enjoyable, even if most of the stories don't have happy endings.  When I read a story, I had no idea where Bradbury is leading to until the last page or so.  I always felt a "gotcha" feeling behind each tale.  High recommendations for science fiction readers who want to read stories that don't take a lot of time but that are unforgettable (at least most of them endure in me in some form).
