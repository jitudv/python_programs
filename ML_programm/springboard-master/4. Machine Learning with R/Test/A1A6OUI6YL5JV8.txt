The author presents glimpses of the Chinese (and Chinese-American) mind-set and ways of dealing with the eternal problem of being an almost &#34;Stranger in a Strange Land,&#34; without malice to either culture.  Each of her books is MUST_READ for anyone who wants a REAL view of the life (or lives) of real people! Neither totally tragic nor comic, her books all show life as it is lived. I frequently wonder how much is her own experience.
