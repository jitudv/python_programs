A prequel as well as sequel to The Bronze Horseman. Much of what we heard about in The Bronze Horseman is repeated but in more depth. We are given more information on Harold and Jane Barrington and how Alexander fared when he was brought over as a child to the Soviet Union.We learn of his escape on his way to Vladistock prison at age 17. We see again how he meets Demetri, who helps him locate and visit his father in jail and who subsequently becomes a ball and chain around Alexander. Again we see how he meets Dasha and later Tatiana. Some of the Lazarevo scenes are repeated.The reader observes what actually happened in Lake Ladoga and subsequently when the NKVD came for Alexander.The story is hair-raising. The brutality of war and all its hellishness is well described. What I found most thrilling was Tatiana's input in Alexander's freeing. That woman has balls! the story shouted.However, some of the story was hard to believe. Alexander smoked like a chimney but was a super fit soldier. The number of times he narrowly escaped death made me think he was a cat with nine lives. While not a surgeon, he successfully performed throat surgery on Pasha, who seemed to recover immediately.All in all a very good read, which I preferred  to The Bronze Horseman.
