Anti-statists, anti-industrialists, NRA ideologues, and neo-cons of the world, take heart!  There is a small nation that has turned itself into a laboratory for your social vision.  Divesting itself of government, industrial technology, local arms control, and sickly notions of political correctness, human rights, or civil society, Albania has plunged deep into the brave new world of the 21st century by rediscovering its roots in the 12th.While I've never been to Albania, I find most of the criticisms made of this book to be rather unfair.  One reviewer made a catalogue of alleged inaccuracies, but failed to add the author's caveats of "so I/as I was told."  If Mr. Carver was spreading disinformation, it was thanks to his Albanian hosts feeding him their own misinformation or paranoia.  As for his "condescending" views, these seem to reflect a certain First World snottery, but were no doubt enforced by the sense of personal threat as a lone traveller in a "fledgling Balkan democracy."  On the other hand, Carver does note acts of generosity and hospitality he received throughout his journey.  He ends his book with a deep but unsentimental appreciation for the people and culture he has just passed through, alive to tell the tale.I found it quite ironic to read of the Communist genocide museum, and its statistics quoted so freely, when all around is a society seemingly hell-bent on self-destruction, decimating itself by unrelenting homicide and emigration.  However patronizing his account may read, one has only to keep in mind the bitter ethnic blood wars raging just to the north of the country at the time of his visit; confirmed by Albania's own utter collapse as a functioning state and civil society just a year later, the path now followed by "Free Libya."Rather than gloating over such tragedy, however, I would be heartened if the country has made some kind of recovery in the intervening years.  To portray it, however, I would want as merciless a mind's-eye scalpel as Mr. Carver's, over the sugar-coating of Western diplomats, EU investors, NATO attaches and evangelical missionaries.
