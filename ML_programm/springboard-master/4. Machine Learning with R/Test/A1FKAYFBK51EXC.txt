With already thousands of comments about the book what more is there to say?While reading the book I am totally engrossed.  Each chapter is well written with lots of details and interesting.The problems are: Characters continue to be added to the point that it is hard to remember who is who. there are multipe kings, queens and princes, and more knights than one can imagine.  There are multiple companies of sellswords.  The are multiple free cities each with their retinue of stange sounding advisors and leaders.  There are at least 4 major religions, and an uncountable number of gods. There are as many plots & schemes as their are charcters.  It is not uncommon for a character be drowned, stabbed or knocked out at the end of a chapter, only to be found alive several chapters later.Two characters who have not seen since the end of book 3 show up at the end of book 5.  Game of Thrones has become like a lot of TV shows that start off amazing but in their suprise popularity jump off the tracks in trying to keep fans interested (e.g. "Lost").I am not sure if George Martin has it all planned out or is just winging it at this point, but it would seem the vast majority of fans, myself included, would like to see the focus narrow, not broaden. He has built a truly amazing universe. If he could just use the next book or 2 to allow some closure to many of the stories and stabilization to the rule of Westeros, he can then he keep writing books of new adventures, uprisings and stories of different characters and regions.  Let's hope this happens.
