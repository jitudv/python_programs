This is the story of the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn as seen through the eyes of her less-well-known sister, Mary.  It is a tale of passion and intrigue.In the beginning of the book, Mary is an obedient daughter of the Howard/Boleyn family.  She marries William Carey at the age of 12.  A few years later, when ordered to do so by her family, she leaves his bed to become the mistress of the king.  In its quest for power, the family considers its daughters to be disposable fodder - used to attract and hold the king.  It is only later, as Anne succeeds her as the king's favorite, that Mary decides to follow her own path.  This contrasts with the fates of Anne and her borther George - who sacrificed all in their quest for power.The book also brings to fresh life the familiar Tudor personages - Henry VIII and his first three wives Katherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, and Jane Seymour.Highly recommended for those who enjoed historical fiction.
