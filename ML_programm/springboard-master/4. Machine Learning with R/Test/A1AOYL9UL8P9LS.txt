Dance With Dragons is a good book and a worthy entry in the series.First I would like to say that many will disagree with this but a lot has happened here. The thing is you must understand that much of it takes place in the same timeline as 'A Feast For Crows' and other than the last 250 pages or so does the story progress from that time. I understand why this would upset many people as they want the series to move forward as to what happens next however these events all have great relevance and for me made the previous 2 books that much better. I will not spoil the fun within but we learn of what some of the main characters have been doing or not doing since 'Storm' and feeds into what could happen next which is what a good series is about. I look forward to the next 2 with great anticipation as I am now without a good series read and will have to see if Robert Jordan is as good or bad as others have proclaimed.In short if you have been pleased by the first 3 books and left shaking your head at the 4th don't be discouraged by the bad reviews here get the book!
