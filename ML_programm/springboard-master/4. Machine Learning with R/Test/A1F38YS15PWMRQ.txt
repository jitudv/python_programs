Christie has some many books which could be termed "her best" that the title becomes somewhat cliche. Almost all Christie's book could be considered her ebst, from my personal favourite "Death Comes As The End", to the one i liked least "Passenger to Frankfurt" which i am sure many other people loved.All of her books are ingenious, intriguing, and feature a mind-bending puzzle or a fast-paced adventure.This is no exception. this is porobably one of her most famous, and it's easy to see why. it's completely original and the solution is so unexpected...The plot runs at such high speed...there's practically a death per chapter...and each person who pops their clogs is murdered in tune with the rhyme "Ten Little Indians". there is a subtle build up of suspense and terror until the final two people remain on the small island, isolated from the world, convinced the other is the killer. paranoia runs rife among the final few victims, and when at last the final ones gets it, we think it's all been sorted out. but oh no.In the final chapter christie pulls of a brilliant twist, and one that i totally did not see coming. she really pulls the wool over the readers eyes.a very enjoyable book. highly reccomended
