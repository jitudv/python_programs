I just reread this great little primer on management and found it just as helpful as I did fifteen years ago. While its concepts are simple, they are also quite effective IF managers (including teachers, parents, and front-line supervisors) would implement them correctly. The three secrets of one-minute goal setting, one-minute praisings,and one-minute reprimands are based on sound behavioral principles and are bound to work as long as certain guidelines are met. For instance, goals should be realistic and specific, praisings should be sincere and immediate, and reprimands should end with a bit of encouragement. I love the idea of managers walking around trying to catch people doing things right. What a refreshing idea!Read the book and apply the principles in your home, office, or factory. While the three guidelines won't solve every human relations problem, they offer sound, practical advice that will lay the foundation for effectiveness.
