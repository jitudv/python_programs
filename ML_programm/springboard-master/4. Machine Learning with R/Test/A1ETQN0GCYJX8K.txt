I should preface this by saying that I absolutely love historical fiction, and - for that genre - Philippa Gregory is my favorite author....WHEN that historical fiction is based on actual historical figures or events.  Gregory does a beautiful job of opening the reader's mind to the what-ifs of the history lesson that you didn't learn in high school or college, and for that reason she's a fantastic author of historical fiction.Unless the characters are entirely a product of her imagination and not at all based on historical people or events.  And then you might as well skip it.Such is the case with "The Wise Woman."  This book was a complete waste of time.  I read another reviewer compare it to a Stephen King novel, and I really think that reviewer hit the nail right on the head.  If you enjoy Stephen King and you're not looking for historical fiction, you might like this book.  If not, skip it entirely and look toward her much better books like "The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Constant Princess."Bizarre, unrealistic, demonic and creepy are the only adjectives I can come up with to describe this book.  I will certainly be more discerning in my future Philippa Gregory selections, as this isn't the first time I've been burned.  I could say the same about the "Wideacre" series which was like watching a train wreck.  You know you should look away, but you just can't help yourself and so you keep reading, only to wish you'd looked away when you had the chance.
