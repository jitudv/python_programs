The whole series of Jack Ryan books are a must read if you are interested at all in the political politics and follow current trends in Government.  These Executive Orders are a little different from President Bush and President Obama but that is the idea where this story line came from.  Jack Ryan's Executive Orders are much more exciting and he is an independent with no party affiliation so Democrat's and Republicans can both be interested in this series.  Jim H.
