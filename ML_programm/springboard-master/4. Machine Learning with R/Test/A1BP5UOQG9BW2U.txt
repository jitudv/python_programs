I'm a little late coming to this author and this book but I'm glad I finally got here.  I didn't figure out the killer until it was finally explained at the end.  Of course in hindsight it makes perfect sense.  If you're hesitating to read this book because it was written so long ago...don't wait any longer.  You'll be glad you invested the time.
