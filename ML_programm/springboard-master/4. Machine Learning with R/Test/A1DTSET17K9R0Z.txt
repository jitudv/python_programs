I can see how &#34;Dust&#34; won an American Library Association Best Books for Young Adults. It fairly hums with the electricity of youth. But don't let that trip you up as an adult reader from what is a wonderfully evocative fantasy that manages to stay fully grounded in the here and now.Well, technically that's the &#34;there and before&#34; because the story is set after WWI as drought ravages North America, which includes  the small farming town of Horseshoe in Canada.  Right off the bat we meet seven year old Matthew Steelgate walking to town with five cents in his pocket and hankering for gum and licorice. He is picked up by a stranger in a truck in a scene where Slade conveys the almost workman like menance of said stranger without making anything really untoward happen.Matthew's disappearance is the trigger for the novel, which is not a horror story such that Stephen King might terrorfy you with, but more a kind of 'lights on' ghost story that reminded me of Neil Gaiman.Our truck driving stranger has mysterious powers indeed and it seems that only Malcolm's older brother, Robert, can resist the lure of his evil spell and hopefully save the day.What elevates &#34;Dust&#34; above most other novels is the brilliance of Slade's writing. In particular, using eleven year old Robert as the protaginist allows Slade to play with words, drawing us into the emotion of the situation as Robert carefully considers words and phrases that are new to him, and through him, made fresh to us. The magic in play is credible because Robert makes it credible. As we see, adults are guileless to their slowly changed circumstances and the younger children lack the critical thinking that on-the-cusp-of-manhood Robert deploys.This is masterful stuff. A short-ish, very tight novel with a self-consistent logic that was made credible because of Robert and because Slade paints a wonderful picture of a post-war society where such goings on seem not just likely, but almost inevitable.And at 99 cents when I bought my Kindle copy, it is definitely worth trying, no matter your age.
