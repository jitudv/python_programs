My daughter asked for this, she wanted a prety copy of the book. I was surprised that she asked, not for the book,but for the collectable version as well as one she would read...It is a lovely edition. When she first asked me for this copy, I was not going to purchae it at the full price the bookstore had it listed for. When I found on Amazon.com, I ordered it right away. It is worth so far more that the price I paid. She is also learning responsibility, taking care of somehting that you care about...
