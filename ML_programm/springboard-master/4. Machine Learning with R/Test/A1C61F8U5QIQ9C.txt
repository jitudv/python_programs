There needs to be no explanation of how awesome of a writer Tolken is....but it case I must. The hobbit and TLOTR are beautifully written and the plots are complex but accessible to those not familiar with fantasy writing. These are a good starter for those wanting to dive into fantasy genre but dont know where to begin.
