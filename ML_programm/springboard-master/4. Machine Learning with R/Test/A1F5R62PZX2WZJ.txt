Our 7th grade class had to read &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; for Literature class. My older brother had read it the previous year for the same class, and he said that &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; was a  great book. He and I don't usually read the same type of books, so I  thought I might not like this book. But let me tell you, this book was so  suspenseful, and it really WAS a mystery... it's how a real mystery should  be written. It may seem obvious at who the killer is, and it may seem easy  to predict, but you will be shocked at the ending of the book... I know I  was!
