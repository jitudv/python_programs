I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Hawke tells a tale of young romance that I think most of us can relate to and will remember long after we put the book down.  It is well written and a quick read, so it won't take you long to get through it.  I find it rare to pick up a book that I don't want to put down, but this was one of those gems.
