I really enjoy Isabel Wolff's character development and plot-lines, and The Making of Minty Malone doesn't disappoint.  It's not literature, but it's slightly more weighty than fluff, so I never feel like I'm wasting my time diving into an absorbing story.  Ms. Wolff has a flair for writing dialogue, and believable plot points and characters, and this story about a less-than-assertive British woman who finds her voice and doesn't lose herself in the process is a satisfying read.
