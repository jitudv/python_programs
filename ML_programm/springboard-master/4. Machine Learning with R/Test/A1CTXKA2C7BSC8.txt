This is the first fantasy book that I've read - I picked it out of the library having read the back and thought I'd give it a go. Not sure what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised.The basic story is that of Mykkael, a former mercenary who is now a soldier in the peaceful kingdom of Sessalie. He is from the far south of the country and his skin is much darker in colour, thus he suffers comments from the citizens of Sessalie for his difference. He is mistrusted by many of the people and is the first on whom suspicion falls when anything goes wrong.And it does go wrong. Princess Anja is about to receive her future husband at her betrothal ceremony when she disappears. Mykkael is tasked to find her, although he seems to spend the first half of the book doing nothing but getting involved in kingdom politics and rubbing people up the wrong way. I found the first half of the book a little hard going.However, when he finally sets out to track Princess Anja the story comes to life. He finds the Princess with her six horses and the two of them have to cross "Hell's Chasm", a long deep valley, in order to find safety in another kingdom. The descriptions of their hardships and the battles they have to fight against evil creatures is gripping and keeps you turning the pages.The reason they are endangered is that Anja's Bridegroom has bought demons and sorcery with him from his home country - he isn't in fact her bridegroom, he has been possessed by an evil sorcerer. Various other members of the Royal Household are endangered and there's quite a lot of bloodshed - Mykkael having his fair share in that before he leaves to track the princess.The characterisation is good, with Mykkael as a tortured hero - tortured by the fact that although he is usually successful in his mission, there is always a heavy price to pay. Anja understands her duty as Princess and does her utmost to fulfil them, although she is somewhat hampered by tender feelings for her horses. Warning - if you can't bear the thought of horses or dogs being killed, this book isn't for you.The kingdom of Sessalie and the other places mentioned are well drawn and I felt that I understood the society and the peoples - rather like mediaval Britain. It worked well for me and was different enough to be interesting.I did enjoy this book although I was a little disappointed by the ending, and I also think that the first half was a bit slow - thus the four stars. Otherwise I would have given it five.
