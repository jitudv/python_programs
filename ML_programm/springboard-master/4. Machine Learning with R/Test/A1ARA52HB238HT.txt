This book will have a grasp on you as soon as you open it. Ten strangers, a curious assortment of men and women from different walk of life, are summoned as weekend guests to a private island off the coast of Devon by a mysterious man U. N. Owen. Each guest identifies common relations with Owen and yet Owen is unknown to them. It is a pre-announced murder spree. One by one, the house guests fall prey to an unknown, myseterious killer in the house, according to the scheme walled up in individual guest room-the rhyme of ten Indian boys. This is a book that fills up with suspense, panic, and thrill. As more house guests fall prey, the remnants escalate vigilance but also distrust. Speculation and doubts roam in of their mind. And only the dead are above suspicion. This is definitely a page turner. I finish the book in a day, with perspiring hands, accelerating pulse and a cloud of speculation in my mind. Good read. 3.3 stars.
