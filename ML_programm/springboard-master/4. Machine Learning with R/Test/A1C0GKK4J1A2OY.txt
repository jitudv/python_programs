The BBC's performance of The Lord of the Rings is first-rate, though book purists may have problems with it.  It's an adaptation, and the writer(s) played with the chronology a bit--they've added some flashbacks early on that take the place of narrative later in the books--but overall, the dramatic impact is a definite plus.The actors are fantastic--for tone, emotion, and character, you won't hear better.  The script is well-written enough to get more than just the main points of the story across without being a word-for-word reading.  I highly recommend this for any Tolkien fan who loves the story but doesn't demand absolute faithfulness to the script.
