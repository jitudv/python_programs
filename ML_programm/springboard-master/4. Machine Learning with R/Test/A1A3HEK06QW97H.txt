I'm not sure if it's my fault or the book's fault, i just couldn't seem to grasp what's it's all about. It keeps repeating the same thing by giving us numerous way to illustrate the idea of black and white versus gray. It's bought last year and i still haven't finished yet (if I'm to finish it), during that period i've already read like 50 of other bestsellers and they didn't disappoint me except this seemingly popular book. I'm still open to the possibility of my own fault, email me if you want to enlighten me.
