This lovely novel builds slowly but surely, weaving a spell around the reader. I particularly like the fact that the author has focused the book around a woman who has suffered from depression and even outright psychosis at certain points in her life. And yet she doesn't seem frightening or weird but simply as a person who is doing her best in spite of the challenges she faces, both emotional and otherwise.  This woman, Rae Newborn, has had a difficult life. Her periodic depressions, breaks with reality and unpredictable behavior have left her realtionship with her daughter (the product of an early marriage) severely strained. She has a son-in-law who is equally unloving and on the verge of keeping her grand-daughter from her, a girl Rae loves dearly. And there have been other troubles, deep ones, in Rae's life - crises I won't reveal here (not wanting to spoil the story). The past and recent pains in Rae's life have left her shell-shocked and fearful.  Still, she's a resilient woman and she decides the best way to cure her pain is to confront it head on, with no one to turn to for support except herself. She moves to an island and decides to build a home which was started by another member of her family, long ago.  And that's when things come to a climax - although it's a climax that builds gradually, allowing the reader to get to know Rae and her past more fully. I found this to be an extremely satisfying read, one that left me feelng as if I knew Rae quite well. I also liked the fact that the author did a fine job of demystifying mental illness. I felt drawn to Rae, to her courage and her willingness to take huge risks to become the person she wanted to be.
