Arguably one of Arthur C. Clarke's best novels.  Classic Sci-Fi, beautifully written.The story deals with the spread of humans across the galaxy, once it has been determined that the sun is dying and will go supernova.  &#34;Seeder&#34; ships have been sent out to create new civilizations on worlds identified as compatible with human life.In this story, the residents of Thalassa, a planet primarily of ocean with small land masses, must interact with another seeder ship that is in need of repairs in order to continue its voyage to a planet 300 light years away.  The interaction between the Thalasseans, who lead a bucolic, agrarian life, and the people on the space ship is reminiscent of the interactions between the Pacific Islanders and the seafarers of the 1800's.
