This dictionary has two major virtues: (a) it is really small, (b) it's not paperback, but rather &quot;plasticback&quot;: the jacket is of a reasonably resistant plastic material.  I haven't found any dictionary of similar size that is as solid.  Thus, this is the dictionary I take in my travel backpack.I haven't really pondered whether it's as good as the alternatives in terms of entries and such; but I just don't have to worry as much about its getting destroyed in transit.
