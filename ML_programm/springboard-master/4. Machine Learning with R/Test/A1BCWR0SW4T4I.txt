Agatha Christie, did it again. People, this is a must read. We have Simeon Lee, a rich and powerful man. He had five children, four boys and a daughter,who died the previous year,  a grown granddaughter, whom he never met, from his deceased daughter. Of his sons, there is a kiss up, mama's boy, money hungry one and a wild one.Now all of them have left home except the eldest one,(the kiss up). Simeon decided to invite all of his other sons and his granddaughter to come home for Christmas and for the granddaughter to come and live there. The sons agreed, thinking the old man was going to bury the hatchet and they would be a family again.After every one was settled, the old man summoned them to his room. The old man proceeded to lam into them, telling them that they were worthless and blasted his deceased wife for being weak and giving him worthless sons, and that his granddaughter was worth two of them.Now you know that this pissed the sons off, especially the mama's  boy. He demanded they leave his room and he will see them in the morning.Everyone was in the dinning room when they heard this loud crash and furniture being flung about. Everyone raced upstairs to the father's room only to find the door locked. The fellers tried to shoulder ram the door, but it would not budge. So they used something else to break the door down. Now this door is a heavy mahogany wood  When they entered the room they found their dad lying on the floor with his throat slit from ear to ear, and so much blood,from such a frail man.Now mind you the door was locked, one window was latched,the other open about 6 inches, was that way for decades, because it was stuck and the furniture in the room was of the same mahogany wood.Not one of his sons, except the kiss up, liked the dad, and after that blow out in the old mans room. All I can say is so many suspects and so many motives.
