In And then there were none, ten unaquainted people are lured out to an island under false pretenses. Upon arriving, they learn their mysterious host, a U.N. Owen has not yet arrived. In fact, they soon discover their host will not arrive. Through the use of a gramophone a recording plays accusing the ten people of certain crimes from their past.One by one the stranded visitors begin to drop like flies. The question is, who this elusive U N Owens and why have these ten random people been chosen as victims? The ending wasn't as shocking as in Murder on the Orient Express, but I still managed to remain somewhat in the dark until the end. Although, I had my suspicions, which turned out to be accurate!A word of caution, if you haven't read this novel, don't read too many reviews. Some of them, in my opinion, reveal too much information.  It's best to read an Agatha Christie novel with as little clues as possible. If you haven't read it yet, read Murder on the Orient Express, but don't scroll all the way down the page to read any reviews on Amazon. Someone thought it would be cute to reveal the identity of the murderer as the subject of their review.
