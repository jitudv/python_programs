This book has the fellowship scattered in every which way. Frodo is traveling through Mordor with Sam, while Pippin and Merry show incredible inner strength in their encounters with orcs. Gandalf (who is supposedly killed in book 1) resurrects with gallantry as Gandalf the White. The characters begin to take on more and more challenges. Frodo is gettin guided by who but Gollum and a new type of soldier emerges--Ents. Readers are introduced to Faramir, Theoden, Wormtongue, and the Rohirrim. The trail to the final battle between good an evil narrows ever-more as the book draws to a close. Each reader has begun to see each character in a new light, truces are made, blood is shed, and now readers can begin to decide who is the most important character in the book. I personally have never been able, as all characters play such an immense part in the story of the rings. I recommend both the book and the recording (Rob Inglis is the most incredible reader).
