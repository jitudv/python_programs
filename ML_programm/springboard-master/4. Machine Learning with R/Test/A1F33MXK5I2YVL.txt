There is a terrific novel in here but like the last few books it is buried and strangled with the glacial pace and extraneous bits that clutter it up. Also like the last books there is no attempt to have a book that stands on it's own with a beginning, a middle and an end. We are left abruptly with no resolution to the story or most of the characters.Given the amazing breadth of plot and deep character development and the fabulous and richly fleshed out world that has been developed maybe I am being too picky? But I feel as if some talented editor could go through and help make this much tighter and faster moving book. But while I am gripping about the pacing and lack of resolution there can be no question about the brilliance of the author's creation. I am speechless with admiration about his willingness to brutally eliminate favorite characters in keeping with the nature of the world he has created which has allowed this series to avoid the boring predictability and tiredness that so many series fall into as the same lead characters have the same kinds of adventures over and over.I may be complaining but I am still hooked and at this point I am thinking we may never get typical book style character resolution. After all in real life there are no nice tidy resolutions and these characters and this world is more like looking down on what is happening in another world than reading a story
