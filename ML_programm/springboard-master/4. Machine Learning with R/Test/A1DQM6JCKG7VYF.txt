At long last I read the final volume all the way through on my third stab at the trilogy.  I've just always run out of gas after the first 1000 or so pages so it made sense to just start with this one and give it the attention it deserves (especially after seeing the film).  I was suprised at how much I enjoyed the journey of the hobbits back to the Shire to kick some hindquarters as toughened warriors.  Also, this was the first time for me that a book (or movie) took the time to delve into the feelings of the protagonists as their heroic climax passes and they fade back into to normal life.  I found it useful in my own life.
