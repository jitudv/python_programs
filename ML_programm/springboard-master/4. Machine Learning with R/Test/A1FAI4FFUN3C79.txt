If I wasn't already bought into the series with books 1-4 (and if I hadn't waited 6 years for it) I would not have finished this book. This book is a perfect example of what happens when you don't plan out exactly what you're doing. I think GRRM really screwed up big time with AFFC and now this. He introduced too many PoVs and the book starts to feel really disjointed about halfway through when it seems like nothing happens with many of the main characters just so we can get more of the PoVs in. Characters like Victarion and Asha are super interesting and all, but they just don't advance the overall story.The mark of a series going sour in books and in TV is usually when you watch/read a bunch of stuff without anything really happening. There is really no other way to describe this book. Let's look at some examples (minor spoilers):Tyrion - A favorite character to many; last we heard from him he was being squirreled off by Varys. In this book, he goes across the narrow sea and then does.... essentially nothing. If you read the preview chapter for Tyrion on GRRM's site, then you're pretty much where I am after reading the book.Danaerys - This was the biggest travesty of them all. Literally zero movement here.Jon - This character had some movement, though if you've read the preview chapter (posted on GRRM's site in 2008) there is really nothing of interest here until the last Jon Snow chapter in the book.Theon - This character was pointless and drawn out.Overall, as well, there is VERY little different in this book.The whole idea of this book is to try and take as long as possible to build stuff up as to make even the smallest changes seem epic. Things like Theon's escape attempt takes many, many needless chapters of labored anguish. Why?!The whole book is structured foolishly as well: the first half is split about evenly between Tyrion, Jon, and Danaerys with some Theon sprinkled in. The characters move slowly, but it's acceptable. After the first half, the book turns into PoV after random PoV. Asha, Victarion, Melisandre, Barristan, it's just random person after random person and then it brings people back from AFFC. Of course, nothing is going to get tied up! The story basically stops halfway through the book!This is the problem with this whole 'time split' thing. He needed more PoVs for AFFC and so now he needs to wrap those PoVs up, even though the story doesn't need them to continue. Textbook case of good intentions gone wrong. Bit sad to see this happen to a great series.
