When I was searching for this TAPED version of the LOTR and found this item, I noticed that most of the reviews (2,000+) were for the book, or rather, the several different editions of the book. Various booik formats are even listed below the title of the item on its page. I never understood why this was so, as the item is clearly shown to be the Trilogy Gift set of the LOTR and an audio cassette narrated by Rob Inglis.When I did find someone who reviewed this item itself and not these other things, and when I found someone who commented upon Mr. Inglis' narration, I decided to check it out with the seller to make sure I was getting tapes and Inglis. I did. And the box set was NEW and still in shrink wrap! And the cost was nominal. That's because I am using an old technology. Tape cassettes are OLD! It's all CDs now or whatever other thing they've come up with. So being OLD it was cheap. What a deal!Anyway, I am now happily listening to my cassettes in my car where I play all my books on tape. It sure makes driving more bearable. And Rob Inglis is indeed good. Excellent production values as you would expect from Recorded Books LLC. You ought to hear Mr. Inglis read Galadriel's song, which is written in Quenya!Ai! laurie lantar lassi surinen,Yeni unotime ve rdmar aldaron!Yeni ve linte yuldar avdniermi oromardi lisse-miruvoreva...Wow! He also sings when there are songs by others (Sam, Bilbo et al).So, I am pleased with this item. I recommend it to all of you few out there who still use tape cassettes and who are, of course, Tolkienarians.
