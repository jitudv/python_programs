I can't say enough good things about this book. It's a beautifully crafted and dramatically conceived novel that compares two generations, contrasts the immigrant experience with the experience of the native born, and explores the traditional and changing roles of women in China and in the United States. This is simply a great story and it never lags or bores you. I zipped through it quickly, and I look forward to re-reading it again in the near future.
