Most people either love Paulo Coelho's writing or absolutely hate it.  I haven't seen many who have straddled the fence on this author.  I'm in the former category, though I know quite a few people who don't care for him at all.  While some believe his writing is too simplistic, I, on the other hand, sometimes crave simplicity!  I do quite a bit of heavy reading (though not recently), and it's nice sometimes to curl up with one of Coelho's books and know that I will probably read it in one sitting.  I also believe his 'simple' books have a much deeper meaning to them, and this story is also indicative of that.One day a stranger comes to Viscos, an idyllic mountain town.  The stranger has a plan to tempt the villagers with some gold.  They only have to do one thing to get the gold, but that act is contrary to the basic character of the town's residents.  There hasn't been any trouble in the village for years, and when Miss Prym, the local barmaid, is told of the plan, she is confident the villagers will be able to withstand the temptation.The story raises the question of whether humans are generally good or generally evil, and also why God, if there is one, would allow evil things to happen to good people.Highly recommended.
