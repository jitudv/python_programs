A woman is framed for a crime she didn't commit and left to rot in prison with no hope for release.  She is abused and forced to act &quot;tough&quot; and learn the ways of the criminal to survive.  She is able to engineer her escape and get back at those who wronged her.  Having been &quot;soiled&quot; of character, revenge on those who wronged her is not enough.  She then proceeds to become a super high-class con artist.  The book goes on to tell one sting after another.  An interesting one involves conning to chess masters into thinking she if playing each, where in fact they are playing against each other.The woman decides to do one last score and then retire.  This will turn out to be a real tough thing to accomplish.I have read about 10 Sheldon books and this is by far my favorite.  It raises the question, does a person's environment determine whether they will become a criminal or does the genes?Sheldon goes for the former in this book.
