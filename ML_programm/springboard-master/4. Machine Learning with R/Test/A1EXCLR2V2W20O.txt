I write this immediately after commenting on the Hobbit.  I was inspired to write another after this, for the Silmarillion.To me the three books intertwine into three levels of journey, from lower to higher levels of conciousness and expression of imaginative genius.The Lord of the Rings can certainly stand it's ground as a saga and a work of a brilliant mind.  Having learn't a little of Tolkien himself, it is clearly evident this work is the result of a lifetime of toil.  The cumulative expression of his experiences and knowledge, accentuated with the playful abandon of a child, sobered by the grim wisdom of a sage; this is the Lord of the Rings.The scale of this work had an effect on me similar to mythologies and legends of ancient civilizations - of our own world.  But the world Tolkien created here was a complete immersion.  I could taste and smell it.  I yearned for it.  I suffered with the heroes in the book, and I revelled with them in their moments of joy.  I felt the yawning agony of defeat and death, and the mourning of times lost.The world Tolkien created was ever in a state of decay.  Call it entropy in our scheme.  Evermore the purity and innocence of ages past faded away and died.This did not distress me.  For every now and then brave souls on this journey gathered their spirits, and in mutual kindness, brought forth joy.  That was the victory, that was the achievement.  And those moments made up for all the suffering and toil.The book is HUGE, but I relished each page and dreaded the end.  Such is it's excellence.
