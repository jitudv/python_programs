This book ending made me angry.  Frankly, reading this Martin's series has given more frustration than pleasure.  I read 5-6 novels a week but I put his down and move to a different author all together knowing I'm going to be disappointed or frustrated. Happily the HBO series is better than the books, go figure.  I will say Martin's writing is very engaging, his attention to detail does teleport me there as an observer but his books continuations and/or endings leave me cold, wondering why I bothered.M. Archer
