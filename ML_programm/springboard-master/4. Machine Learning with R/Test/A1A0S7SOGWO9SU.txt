I strongly believe that everything we do is for the purpose of preparing us for something in the future. I don't believe in fate or astrology, but I do think that life is a journey and we don't have the tools for that journey at birth - we earn them. It's like school. First grade prepares you for second, which prepares you for third, and so on.The Namesake, by Pulitzer Prize winning author Jhumpa Lahiri, is about the Ganguli family and the journey of that family as one unit and about some of their individual journeys. Ashoke comes to the United States to make a life for himself and eventually returns to India to marry Ashima and bring her back home with him. The reader is not shown much of Ashoke's transition into American culture, but we see every painful detail of Ashima's. Coming straight from India, she does not have all the tools to cope with life here. Gradually though, her experiences prepare her. Her children make that transition much more smoothly.Early on in Lahiri's tale, Ashoke is in a train accident. He survives with only a limp, but his car-mates all die. When Ashoke and Ashima have their son, they name him after one of the men who died in the car - Gogol. The naming of something, be it a person or an object, is a powerful moment. Gogol's parents name him because they know that the train accident played a pivotal moment in their life. Gogol takes more than 30 years to understand that lesson. It takes those 30 years before he accrues the life experiences that leave him ready for that information.Lahiri is a beautiful storyteller and the book is an easy read. She transitions from character to character but the reader never loses touch of the central story of one family - of family in general. There are two lessons Lahiri gives. First, as time moves on, so do peoples' lives. In each moment something new is learned and that lesson can be applied later. No moment is meaningless. Second, family is necessary, though not necessarily in the biological sense. We need family for support, for love and for a foundation. It is family who knew us when and will know when we change, grow, excel, decline. When we don't have family surrounding us, we can make our own up of friends, lovers and neighbors.
