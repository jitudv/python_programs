I absolutely loved the beginning! I enjoyed the flashbacks that give us more insight into Alexander's story before he and Tatiana meet in the first book. Even though they are apart, I still enjoy the love story that is Tatiana and Alexander!The middle left me frustrated. It tended to drag on and make me wonder what kind of love story would spend hundreds of pages on everything but ROMANCE. I seriously wanted to claw Tatiana's eyes out every time she contemplated dropping her son off with the nearest stranger or putting a bullet through her head. If she even remotely believed that Alexander was dead, what reason did she have to live?? Apparently their son was not reason enough??Once Tatiana snapped out of her "woe is me" mode towards the end, it was fantastic.Overall, I still enjoyed the story despite my issues with Tatiana's character.
