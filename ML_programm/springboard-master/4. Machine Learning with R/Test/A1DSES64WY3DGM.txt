This was a truly great new book in the Game of Thrones series, especially after the lackluster A Feast for Crows (the 4th book).  While not much happened (at least with our favorite chabracters) in A Feast for Crows, in A Dance with Dragons we see alot of Tyrion, Jon Snow,and Danyerys, Theon etc ( though not enough of Jamie Lannister).  And while there aren't any slow parts in this book, at many times while reading it, I thought to myself, "wow", not only is this guy a great fantasy writer, he is a great writer in general, bloody brilliant.  So far 4 of the 5 Game of Thrones books could be considered works of art.  The only tough thing is waiting a long time till they come out.  As it is, A Dance with Dragons has inspired me to loop back around to the beginning of the series to revisit how the characters were at the beginning of their journey.  At any rate, look out book number six, here come the Others!
