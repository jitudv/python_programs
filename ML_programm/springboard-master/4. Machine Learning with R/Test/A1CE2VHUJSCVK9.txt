I bought this cookbook for my husband for christmas and he has tried several recipes so far, which we absolutely love!  The art and photography found in this book was beautiful and we enjoyed reading about the history of Thailand.  This cookbook provides a nice background of the country, which makes the recipes special and unique.  These recipes are full of flavors that most people aren't accustomed to, but are delicious and refreshing!
