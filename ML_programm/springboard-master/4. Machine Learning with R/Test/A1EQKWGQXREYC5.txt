this book is a good read.  i heard about it and i bought it!  the price of this book is the best investment i have made since my promotion!  i have read it two times already and i learned something new each time.  the goal setting was a skill that i lacked.  also i was reminded how important praising is to the employee.  my skills were enhanced by this book!!!
