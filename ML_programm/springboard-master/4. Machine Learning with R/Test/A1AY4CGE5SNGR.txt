I've read almost all of Gregory's book about the royals (including The Queen's Fool) but none of her other work. I have to say, I hope her other series isn't as disappointing as this one was. The main character was scattered all over the place: she's good, she's bad, she accepts her power, she shuns it: make up your mind, already! You're supposed to be The Wise Woman. It says so on the cover.Maybe that's the deliberate irony coming into play? (gag cough). Uh, no. Unfortunately, this scattered persona contagion spreads to just about every main character in the book. For example, the Young Lord: he loves her, he doesn't love her, he's sincere, he's a cad. Oh, pick one already.The plot wanders about listlessly with the occasional softcore bodice-ripping page or two to pique your interest before finally flinging itself on the merciful suttee of a conclusion. But I suspect once you close the back cover, you'll feel this was (2, 4, 6?) hours of your life you'll wish you could get back again - to read one of her much-better written historical novels instead.
