Oscar Wilde can turn a phrase and write a double entendre like few others. And he is hilarious. Like Twain, he can point out our foibles and failings, make us cast our eyes down or laugh aloud, or make us cry. A man of flesh and blood and intellect, a man whose life was success and failure, applause and scandal, he could wring every emotion from his audience, having experienced them himself. Read him and weep. And laugh.
