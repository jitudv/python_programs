From Beirut to Jerusalem is a remarkable work, clarifying the muddy waters of the Israeli and Palestinian conflicts.  The book mixes personal stories with regional history, to give both color and context to regional events.The author brings a unique perspective to issues, as he was formerly the New York Times correspondent initially to Beirut and later to Jerusalem.  He brings an objective viewpoint to the topics at hand, which is noteworthy when most books take an extreme position on one side or another.  In addition, he presents an interesting history of the troubles in Israel and Palestine, proposing why certain peace initiatives have failed, as well as proposing an option that just might work.  Like many observers of the region, he mixes hope with a healthy dose of pessimism for a situation that always seems too complicated to be resolved.Since the initial printing of the book, Friedman has achieved international acclaim as an objective expert on both globalization (the Lexus and the Olive Tree) as well as terrorism in the post-9/11 era (Longitudes and Attidues).  Perhaps the acclaim he has received in the current era is what brought about the return of his initial solid work.  The book certainly is as relevant today as when it was written.If there is one book to read to better understand the subject, this is it.
