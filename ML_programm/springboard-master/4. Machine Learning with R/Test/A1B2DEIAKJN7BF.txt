I love books that deal with immigrant experiences and cultural interfaces, and this was an excellent example of one.  The novel introduces you to Gogol and his parents, explaining their natures, feelings, and experiences with immense clarity and gentleness.  While the plot was intriguing, the primary driver of the novel was the characters and the sometimes peculiar and uncomfortable circumstances they encounter as new Americans.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
