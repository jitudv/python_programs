If 'The Murder of Roger Ackroyd' is Agatha Christie's best mystery, 'And then there were none' is her best story. You know the story. People have been imitating it for long enough. A group of people are trapped on an island. Slowly, they start dying until they come to the inevitable conclusion. The murderer is one of the group! Can they figure out who it is before everyone dies?Some people may accuse Christie of being a very simplistic writer, and they may be right. But here Christie shows off her talents, getting inside the heads of every suspect without making it clear who is the killer or proving someone isn't the killer. This is by no means an easy task. And packed on top of that is a sinister atmosphere and thrilling plot. This may very well be Christie's best work, and I would recommend it to everyone.
