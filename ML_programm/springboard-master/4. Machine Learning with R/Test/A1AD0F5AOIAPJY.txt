I think rarely does one say that the movies are better than the books. However, I think this is the case. If this is the first time reading these type series I strongly suggest reading George RR Martin or Terry Goodkind. These are much easier reads.Don't get me wrong I like these books but there really kinda slow compaired to the other authors out there. I am fortunate enough to have all six books bound individually. You do want to make this part of your library.
