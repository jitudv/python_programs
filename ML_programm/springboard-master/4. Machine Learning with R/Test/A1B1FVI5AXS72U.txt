"Do you like being young?" the man asked.Matthew didn't understand the question. He examined the stranger's smiling face. After a moment's thought he answered, "Yes.""I was never young," the man said. He tipped his hat back, showing glistening white hair. "Do you believe me? I was never young."Seven-year-old Matthew is pleased to be walking to town alone. He's busy envisioning how he will be waiting on the corner when his family finally pulls up with their horse and wagon. "See, Mom, I made it. My legs aren't too short," he'll proudly yell.He's surprised as can be to hear a strange truck pulling up behind him.Matthew never makes it to town that day. Only his hat is found.His eleven-year-old brother, Robert, is stunned. Could Matthew have been swallowed by the wind or adopted by a coyote? Sometimes he's even forced to admit, "He's not coming back. Not ever. He's probably dead, okay? Dead. Like a little sparrow that falls out of the nest."Then, a mysterious stranger arrives in town to reopen the decrepit old movie theater. He offers visions and promises that tease and tempt the townsfolk. Only Robert and his Uncle Alden seem resistant to the man's charms. "What a snake-oil trick, all smoke and mirrors," scoffs Alden.Soon, people are forgetting things...things like Matthew's disappearance. Only Robert remembers, and he is determined to find out the truth.Robert is a great character...a boy in love with books and reading (particularly forbidden titles by Robert E. Howard) and a fondness for new vocabulary words, like 'dessicated' and 'cacophony.'The sinister stranger, Abram, is another memorable creature, and his scenes with the doubting Robert are electric."You are on the cusp," Abram explained, "between boy and man, the dreaming and the reality. You must have had a million great dreams in your lifetime. Of armies and swords, candies and milkwhips, wizards and unicorns. The cusp." His lips curled into a soft, sad, smile. "I have never had a dream. Not once.I feel sorry for you. One morning you will get up and your dreams will stay in your pillow."While not exactly a horror novel, there is a terrific,creepy 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' vibe about this book. It was suspenseful, well-written, and I really enjoyed the unusual setting of Depression-era Saskatchewan for a fantasy novel.
