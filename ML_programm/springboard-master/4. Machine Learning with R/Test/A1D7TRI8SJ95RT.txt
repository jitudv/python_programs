This is, as other reviewers have said, the only unabridged BOT version of this classic book. Rob Inglis does a great job reading.But: If you plan on downloading CDs onto your MP3 player, keep reading.The book is broken into 48 CDs (all 3 books (16 CDs per book)). And each CD is broken up into 3 min tracks (about 275 tracks per disc).And no freaking consistent organization.Each CD has a completely (ugh!!!) different way of titling the tracks.So, my Ipod now has 800+ 3 minute LOTR tracks . . . in no particular order!!!There's no way I can listen to the book in chronological order. Instead my Ipod shuffles randomly between tracks, changing every 3 minutes.It's a disaster.But I love this book. So, I'm listening anyway.It's the equivalent of cutting the book into 800 pieces, throwing them in the air, and then reading them:  William S. Burroughs, please meet J.R.R. Tolkien.
