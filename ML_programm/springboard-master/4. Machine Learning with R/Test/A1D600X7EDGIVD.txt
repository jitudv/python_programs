Of all the James Patterson books, Along Came A Spider had to come along, this is an engrossing read, It took two sits for me to read this, it grabs you from the first page and doesn't let go, It follows Detective Alex Cross and his adventure to Stop Gary Murphy/Soneji who appears to have a split personality and he's been accused of murdering two children, one is a famous movie star's child. It's up to Alex to hypnotize Gary and get the truth, he meets Jezzie Flanagan an FBI agent whom he falls in love with. This book will shock you until the ending which has an amazing twist to it. I recommend Beginners of James Patterson this Book, I also recommend it to any body, If you like this read Cat &amp; Mouse which has Gary Soneji in it to. I cannot wait for Violets Are Blue.
