This book starts out wonderfully. Gregory leads us through the court of the king and through the many plots of the various families attempting to come into power. I liked the relationship amongst the Boleyn siblings, it was fascinating and made it feel like you knew these historical characters.However, by the middle of the book the story started to drag. Too much time is spent on how long the sisters waited and waited until they could each marry or have a relationship with the king. Also, something that bothered me, but perhaps not other readers, was that the story become one about sex by the end.Overall, this is a good book that introduces us to this time period, but too long and slow.
