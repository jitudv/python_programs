Well you should read this.  I'm curious how it never got much of a play in the USA, but then his brilliant memoir of WW II, &#34;Quartered Safe Out Here,&#34; was missed too.  Like some other positive reviewers I would have liked a different ending, but this isn't &#34;Captain Blood.&#34;  Read it and wonder. It's quite remarkable.
