This seemed to me like a book trying to cross genres, combining an Austen-like novel of manners with swords and sorcery. Though I always admire an author who tries to bring new things into the fantasy genre, I'm afraid this approach didn't work for me.My first major problem was the point of view, an omnicient third person which slipped all over the place, from person to person, without warning. By its nature, this POV keeps readers at a distance, and I found it really hampered me trying to connect with the characters.Often, the omniscient third person is used to keep important information from the readers -- in this case, the identity of a traitor. Sad to say, I figured it out anyhow.I found that the Austen-like narrative voice only amplified the POV's distancing effect. It seemed remote in itself, a good example of why authors are always being told to "show, not tell." In addition, every verb had an adverb and every noun had an adjective (sometimes more than one). This word buildup slowed the sentences down, blunting the impact of even the most exciting and dramatic passages.I was also disappointed with the plot. Some of the characters came off as deliberately obtuse, perhaps because the plot required everyone to gang up on Mykkael. Although the first half of the novel focused on the rivalry/friendship of Taskin and Mykkael, Taskin pretty much disappeared in the second half. To me this was disappointing, as I did like Taskin in his anal way.Again, I enjoy it when an author tries something new. Wurtz is good enough to keep trying, perhaps teamed with a more demanding editor. I'll look for more of her work in the future.Deby FredericksAuthor of "The Magister's Mask"
