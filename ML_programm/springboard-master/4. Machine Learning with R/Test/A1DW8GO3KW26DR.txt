This book is a good alternative if you are a person that easily get stuck in the TV sofa: Why not read abook instead? This book does not offer any extraordinary reading experience, but you know what you get. The first part of the book is rather prolonged and the other part is predictable. But it is a fantasy novel that deliver the goods: Medieval environs, wizards with (crystal!) sceptres and a haunted keep.
