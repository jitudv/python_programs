Dalrymple is a bird dog who tracks his subject, follows in his footsteps, sniffs out his moods, sorts through details in order to tie up knots, and all the while tells a good story of his own.  He is a thoroughly responsable travel writer and a first-rate journalist, and even the opinions interjected in the text are worth noting, not as someone else's caprice but as a reliable source.
