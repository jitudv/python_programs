On reading, this rose immediately to the top of my favourite books.  The intrigue, the heartbreak, the family dynamics combined with the sense of helplessness that comes from knowing how its going to turn out, makes this book a fascinating read.  Gregory's portrayal of Henry as he evolves from a passionate lover to a coldhearted killer is beautifully done while the romance of the main character, Boleyn's sister and Henry's early lover, Mary, is touching and provides the uplifting ending such a dramatic - and ultimately, tragic - story needs.
