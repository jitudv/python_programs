I mean...its the Lord of the Rings...who cares what I think? That being said, I liked the e-book version. There are little formatting issues here and there, but you still have all of LOTR on your e-reader, so there's really not much to complain about. It would be nice if the links went to direct things in the appendix, but instead they get you lost fairly easily. Maybe that's just me.
