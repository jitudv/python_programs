Along Came A Spider is an extremely interesting story with a twisted plot and plenty of suspense. It is almost like two stories in one&#8212;the evil of the psychopathic perpetrator, and the events experienced by Alex Cross as he becomes immersed in his investigation. The plot is definitely interesting and kept my attention from beginning to end. It is a wonderful mystery, a mind boggling psychological thriller, and contains enough action and events to make one wonder when it all will end. James Patterson still spins a tale that will entice me to read other books written by him.Jeanette Cooper, Author ofWhen Justice is Served
