I have not even opened my set of books yet. This is my back-up set. I read the Trilogy at LEAST once a year. At that rate, I wear out my copies within a few years. I never want to be without and so I have my next set ready to go!I know it is hard to understand, if you haven't read the books, how these books can be for children, young adults, and adults and be compelling for all. But the sheer overwhelming enthusiasm these books generate should tell you that you are not dealing with ordinary or even extraordinary stories. These books are on a level all their own. The magnitude of the creativity and detail is awe-inspiring. The characters are unique, fully-developed personalities. That is amazing in itself considering how many characters there are.In December 2001, the &quot;Lord of the Rings Trilogy&quot; movies will start being released. Whether the movies are good (hopefully) or bad I hope the exposure will inspire many more readers to experience the books. I wanted to share my deep love of these books with anyone who may become curious about what these stories are all about. No matter how the movies turn out you WILL NOT be disappointed by the books!!! OUTSTANDING!!!
