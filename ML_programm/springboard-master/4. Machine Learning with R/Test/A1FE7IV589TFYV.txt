This is a VERY tiny dictionary, which makes it very difficult to read. It also is geared toward British English, which further limits its usefulness for American readers. It is compact and plastic bound, which does make it a true &quot;pocket sized&quot; book, but if you are looking for readability and overall usefulness, I would look a bit further.
