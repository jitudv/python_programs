NOTE: This review contains major spoilers. So if you haven't read the book (or haven't seen the movie) yet, then don't read what I've written below.---------------------------------------------I've just finished "The Return of the King" (and the entire LOTR trilogy) just two days ago. It was an outstanding conclusion to the epic fantasy. Although there were some things that bothered me a bit, I still found myself satisfied with the third installment.First let me say what I DID like about this book.Tolkien has created so much fantastic details with characters and settings. From Minas Tirith to Barad-dur, from dwarves to orcs, he's basically the Emperor of Fantasy. Indeed, modern fantasy writers such as Terry Brooks, Robin Hobb, and the late Robert Jordan (RIP) have been inspired by LOTR. Works like "The Wheel of Time" and the "Sword of Shannara" series contain clear evidence of the Tolkienesque influence. I still prefer "Wheel of Time" over LOTR, but I do admire LOTR for its fantastic detail, and Tolkien's writing style.Frodo sure has changed. In "Fellowship" he's just an average guy in Hobbiton who just happens to have a famous (or should I say "infamous") uncle named Bilbo. When he continues his quest in "Towers" and "Return", he completely changes in personality. The Ring becomes a heavy burden, and it tries to consumes him when he comes closer to Mount Doom. What makes the story deeper is that Frodo tries hard to keep the Ring away from his closest friend Samwise Gamgee. He doesn't want Sam to be consumed by this thing as well, and that's pure friendship right there if you ask me.The Battle of Gondor is probably the most exciting thing that happens in the entire trilogy. So much happens in the chapters "The Siege of Gondor," "The Ride of the Rohirrim," and "The Battle of the Pelennor Fields". You have Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, the Riders of Rohan, the soldiers of Gondor, the orcs of Mordor, the Southrons and Easterlings with their gigantic Ouliphants, and the Army of the Dead all in one battle. It doesn't get any better than that.The chapter with Eowyn and Faramir called "The Steward and the King" is especially touching. Both have gone through so much that they deserve each other. And it's a shame that this is mentioned in just one minute in the (Extended) film. Five more minutes could've helped.All right, now here's what I DIDN'T like about this book.That's it?! Only Theodin and Denethor (as major characters) die in the entire war? The death of a good and noble king is such a f**kin' cliche in the world of fantasy. Couldn't Tolkien kill of several more characters to make us more emotional about this trilogy?I also had a problem with the Southrons and the Easterlings. Was Tolkien racist? Because obviously the Easterlings and Southrons are reminiscent to Middle Easterns, Asian Indians, and Chinese; and they're enemies of Gondor. These people have experienced a huge loss in the Battle of Gondor as much as the orcs from Mordor. I can't help but get pissed off. All of the races in the North (Eriador, Rhovanian, Rohan, Gondor) are basically all White, while the races in the East and South (Mordor, South Gondor) are all Eastern. I can see the racial diversity when it comes to elves and dwarves and men, but why leave out the Asians? But of course, it was only the 50's, and fantasy nowadays have far more racially diverse characters. So another point is taken away from LOTR.And finally, The Scouring of the Shire. I think I agree with Peter Jackson that this is a bit to anti-climactic in both the book and the film (and thank God that they never filmed it). Okay, so the Shire is being destroyed by Saruman and his wild men, and yes, this is a pretty exciting chapter, but is it necessary? Yes and no. Yes for the fact that our four Hobbits have matured and are now ready to face their enemies. No for the fact that we've just read through a major battle in Gondor and near the Black Gate of Mordor, and we've just experienced the climax to the entire trilogy. It gets quite tiring when the second to last chapter is being read.With all ups and downs, The Lord of the Rings is still indeed a classic that must be read. And even though I'm not a big fan of Tolkien's/Jackson's work, I gotta give credit to the men for making me wanting to be a novelist.Grade: B
