I enjoyed the reviews of this book, pretty funyy. This is a pretty good travel book; I like travel writing and have read a lot of it.  Dalrymple's work is as good as anyone else.  In addition to this, I recommend Caroline Alexander's &quot;The Way to Xanadu.&quot;  Dalrymple follows Marco Polor to Xanadu; Alexander follows Coleridge.  Both end up at the same place, but follow very different routes to get there.  Dalrymple follows Marco Polo's route along the silk road and he shares some pretty interesting history of all the places he visits.  Alexander visits the places mentioned in Coleridge's diary in the period just before he wrote the fragment of a poem about Xanadu, which leads her to a variety of places including Florida, amazingly enough.
