Ah, it's hard to write a review on the third book without spoiling some of the fun. I will say, though, that everything wraps up nicely (although not to most readers' &quot;good triumphs evil completely&quot; expectations) in this third installment of Lord Of The Rings.Don't read this book before reading the other two. That might go without saying, but don't even think about it. You will be lost.Again, the book is rich with Tolkien's gorgeous prose. You'll probably never read prose so beautifully wrought by any modern writer out there. I think I will tackle the series a second time when I am older so I can read it aloud to my children.I would say also that there are some nice spiritual undercurrents to this book that makes it fabulous from a moral perspective. You are not just reading a fairy tale, you are learning a bit about courage, duty, honesty and virtue. It's a big book to wrap your mind around, but congratulations to everyone who has journeyed through the first two books to Return Of The King. You won't be disappointed.
