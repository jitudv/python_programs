I guess I had heard initially of the battles of Imphal and Kohima while watching the Documentary World at War as a kid. Over the years I became obsessed with Burma campaign and its literature and narrative histories and have built up quite a library on the campaign. There is a lot here to write about... a battle of titans at the edge of empire in the twilight of empire. Jungle diseases, British county regiments far from home (regional accents replete from a different time), Indian cha wallahs and sepoys -- the backbone of the British Empire - fighting Japanese soldiers and Indian malcontents in the Indian National Army. All in a land ruled by headhunters and ruled over by benevolent and condescending British Officials thin on the ground.While General Bill Slim expected a Japanese offensive, he did not expect the thrust to virtually cut off the 14th Army in the Imphal plain by hitting it so far behind their lines that the entire Army was cut off on the Imphal plain. The key pivot was the hill station of Kohima -- the entire battle hinged here. The Japanese arrived after an arduous march through 100s of miles of jungle with an entire division against a small garrison of Kentish men which numbered as little as 700 men at one one point.The events, people and personalities, British, Indian, and Japanese are the focus of this narrative. Their bravery and seeming ability to simply endure in ways that perhaps modern armies cannot endure. I have been a fan of Mr. Keane since listening to his reports on the BBC.This is not a narrative about grand movements or strategy - those are kept brief and descriptive. This is a narrative of peoples, their experiences and the thoughts marching into a meat cauldron in the middle of jungle. It is a story of disparate men and women coming from around the world, eventually partaking in this battle with focused at times on charges and counter charges over the commissioners tennis court. Where gore, mud, drugery and sheer terror crystalised men to action or broke their minds and spirits on a battlfield that resembed the Somme.There are many stories here told by Keane. Of the an obssessive battle plan, marching three Japanese divisions through jungle with little preparation and not enough supplies - assuming they would survive on captured British supplies as they always had before. How Japan may have just about carried it off but for a small band of British and Indian soldiers who did not yeild Kohima. Eventually Japanese power wained and the supply and men deficit of the British Army eventually was succeeded by brilliant logistical planning of Slim and his staff access to American Dakota aircraft to ferry men into the Imphal plain.The British stood and fought it out. They endureed. They did not run as in the past. The result was predictable. The Japanese Army furiosity was contained and eventually lack of suppplies turned a retreat into a route. With no hope of resupply and little hope of actually making their way back across the Chindwin River the Japanese fought and died - and died well - with a spirit accepting death as "light as a feather."Keane adds a lot to the personal record in his book. Accounts from British, Indian and Japanese are a measure of his splendid research. He does little in adding to the general overview of the battle and does not advance any new ideas. But this is not that type of book. For people having a good background the personal narrative is interesting, but there is little new here. In fact almost no one will have a good understanding of the Burma campaign.... much less even knowing where Kohima is. In this sense Keane has done us a great favour in reminding us in a easily approachable volume that the modern world we live in is separated not only by forgotten battles in Indian and Burmese hills, but also modes of thought that may appear quaint, prejudicial or sheer barbaric are removed from us by a very small amout of historical time. The world is of course a better place for the defeat of Imperial Japan and Indian Independence was surely inevitable, but one wonders at times about the fortitude and perseverance of men for each other and for an idea. Surely those old soldiers --  British, Indian, Japanese -- deserve our consideration. Surely what they did and what they endured should never be forgotten. Keane's book reminds us of the importance of them all...
