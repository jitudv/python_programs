LOTR [Lord of the Rings] has been rated for decades, by readers of the English language, as one of the best classic works of all time -- especially as a fantasy saga written in the early twentieth century. Readers in other languages seem to much appreciate this central master-work of J. R. R. Tolkien as well. To this reader it seems fun, rich, vivid, and very deep.LOTR has most of the basic elements of a classic fantasy saga -- glorious characters, plots, dramas, settings, imagery, prose, poetry, and mystery. The LOTR saga seems to be a finely inter-woven tapestry of core Western cultural themes. Some of these are the interplay of Celto-Nordic, Greco-Roman, and Judeo-Christian aspects -- inspired, as well, by the Kalevala of the Finns and its language. However, LOTR seems to transcend even these sources to become a world classic.LOTR, and associated works, such as the Silmarillion, has greatly inspired the the creators and creation of various fantasy sagas, games, and movies. The recent movie rendition of LOTR, by Peter Jackson and many helpers, is a wonderful example of Tolkien deeply inspiring creativity. The Medieval aspects, such as armor, arms, and action, are well done -- which may honor Tolkien very well.Tolkien had wished for a quality edition of his "trilogy" as one saga in one book. This specific edition of the LOTR "trilogy" seems to go far in meeting this desire. My particular copy is a fine one indeed -- sturdy lovely leather-skinned book-case and book-cover, good semi-classic binding, semi-matte gilded pagination, sharp and clear font, classic place-marker ribbon, and a good choice of maps, pictures, and appendices +++
