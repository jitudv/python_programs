To End All Wars is the story of the author's time in a series of Japanese POW camps during World War II.  I originally became interested in Ernest Gordon after viewing the movie by the same name.  This is a story of courage, endurance, and resolve and the fact that Ernest Gordon and many of his fellow POW's were able to forgive their Japanese guards despite what they had lived through is a testament to the type of men they were.  How many of us could do the same? This is a must read for all WWII buffs.
