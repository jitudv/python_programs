1/18/2013Back to square one.They did it again!!!!!  This is supposed to be about the DELL 2012 edition!  They can not seem to understand WHY we customers want to know about a particular product.  Is a book review JUST about the content of a book or is it possible that it should be about both content and the actual edition you are looking at.  So once again we are back to 1,400 reviews and growing and we are all left hanging.  I used to write a lot of book reviews, cd reviews, and audio book reviews but with this problem only getting worse I have deleted most of these type of reviews.How can a customer decide if a particular book is what they want if they can not also review the binding of a book or it's printing... or in the case of a ebook it's formatting.  These are all things that matter to a purchaser but seem to be too difficult for amazon's review system to segregate the many formats that might be available.1/2/2013(I have deleted my original caution since it appears amazon has resolved the issue of combining reviews for OLD editions, NEW editions, multiple formats, audio formats, cd's etc......)WHEN I POSTED THIS CAUTION THERE WERE OVER 1,400 REVIEWS.THANKS TO WHOMEVER AT AMAZON RESOLVED THIS.ON A SIDE NOTE I DID FILE A NOTE TO AMAZON POINTING OUT THE ERRORS.... You can do the same thing I did.  At the bottom of each item on amazon are two or three buttons you click on and tell amazon CS what is wrong with item description.I encourage everyone to do what I did and file an exception when an item Is so out of whack as this one was.  We the customer were confused by what had been 12 year old reviews for a 2012 new edition of the 4  book set.*********************************************************************I am reviewing the DELL version that was published in the year 2012.*********************************************************************After reading some of the reviews I was concerned that this might not be a quality boxed set.Mine is.  It is a great set for a young child.  It is what I would call a throw away book.... in that he is not going to take care of these books.  They will be tossed around from book bag to book bag.... left laying on the floor of his room etc..........IF you want a quality rendering of these works this is NOT the set you want.  The text is too small and the illustrations are hard to see.It contains the Hobbit and the old style 3 book breakdown of the classic tale.So I am not about to try and review J.R.R. Tolkien. As you probably know C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien were best of friends and each impacted the others works.  The striking similarities between Narnia and The Lord of the Rings is no accident.  They collaborated freely.  The Hobbit is what he is reading now.  I have cautioned him that THE Lord of the Rings is much more complex.The box that holds the 4 books is nice. Looks just like the picture of the item.
