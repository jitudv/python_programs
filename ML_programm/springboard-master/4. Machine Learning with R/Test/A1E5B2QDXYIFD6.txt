I've been a fan of fantasy books for years, mainly because I read and fell in love with &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as a child. Yet I didn't read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; until a few months ago, in anticipation of the new film. Once again I fell in love with Tolkien's Middle-Earth and story-telling ability. I loved the dramatic twists at the end of &quot;The Fellowship;&quot; indeed, I thought I had never read anything quite like it at the time. But the story of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; blew me away.In the first half, Book III, Aragorn leads Gimli and Legolas in hot pursuit of Saruman's band of orcs, who have nabbed hobbits Merry and Pippin. These five members of the now-broken Fellowship find unexpected allies in the Riders of Rohan, and the Ents, ancient dwellers of the Fanghorn forest. The battle at Helm's Deep with the servants of Saruman was riveting.Book IV, which deals with Frodo and Sam's journey towards Mordor, seemed very slow-moving after the events of Books I-III. Still, there are incredible descriptions of the often-barren, mountainous landscape, the hobbits' dealings with Smeagol, and occasional settings of staggering beauty (the groves and thickets of Ithilien, the Window of the Sunset). The sense of impending doom builds as the hobbits draw closer to Mordor. Yet I realized that there was no other way Tolkien could have built up to the conclusion more deliberately or masterfully as I read, late last night and spellbound, the staggering events in the final two chapters of this book.I never thought it possible that &quot;The Two Towers&quot; could be better than &quot;The Fellowship,&quot; but there you have it. I loved Merry and Pippin's encounter with the Ents, and the tree-creatures' deliberate ways. As a student of geology, I couldn't get enough of the beautiful descriptions of mountains and landscapes. I loved how everything in Middle-Earth is steeped in history and lore - even magical objects like the Palantir, with an ambiguous, almost-forgotten history, take on a deeper dimension. Most of all, I loved the moments of the truest kind of friendship. Friendship grows between Gimli and Legolas, two (initially) unlikely companions. And Frodo and Sam, always drawing closer towards the heartland of the Dark Lord, realize that now, more than ever, they must rely on their companionship and loyalty to each other.I couldn't recommend anything more highly, and would also caution you to have &quot;The Return of the King&quot; close at hand!
