This book made me think of the way some Americans criticize immigrants -- in this case Indian immigrants -- for clinging to their own culture and not learning the language.  Keeping an open mind, I tried to identify with an Indian woman, transported to America because of her arranged marriage, having her first baby in an American hospital, with &#34;strangers&#34; rather than family tending her.  Throughout this book, I watched her trying to re-create the culture she had left behind by hosting gatherings of other Indian transplants.  I saw her trying and failing to keep from losing her children to the American culture.  I came to understand the terrible loneliness of those who leave family.  At the same time, I came to understand the necessity of adapting to a new culture and for not keeping one's children torn between two worlds.  This is a good book for someone who has the ability to empathize and feel compassion.
