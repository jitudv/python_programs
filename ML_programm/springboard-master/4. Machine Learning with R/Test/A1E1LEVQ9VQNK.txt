This was my third reading of LOTR (the first was when I was in college in the 1960s). I'm glad to see that the trilogy is now in a single volume the way that Tolkien intended it to be published.LOTR is a classic story of high adventure and the triumph of good over evil, all set in the mythical fantasy world of Middle Earth. The saga is filled with some of the most memorable characters in literature, including hobbits, humans, dwarves, elves, orcs, ents, wizards, and witches. Epic battles are fought throughout the story, from Weathertop, where Frodo is seriously injured, to the final clash outside the Black Gate of Mordor.Those who have only seen the film versions of the three LOTR books owe it to themselves to read the trilogy. There was so much more in the books that could not be shown in the films due to time constraints. For example, in The Return of the King, the third book of the trilogy, there is a whole mini-story of what happens to the hobbits in the Shire after Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin return home. Even after defeating the Dark Lord Sauron, there was more evil to be confronted in the Shire, and from a most unexpected source.My test for a great book is... if I had to be stranded on a remote island for years without contact with the outside world, would it be one of only ten books I could take with me? In the case of LOTR, the answer is a resounding "yes."
