If you think you know this story by the Queen of Crime because you saw the movie, think again.There's no Poirot, no Miss Marple, but this is a good read, and not, I think, typical of Dame Agatha.  I suspect that she appears in this book disguised as the judge.  It's an inside out version of Murder on the Orient Express.  The changes to the plot and characters made for the movie version suggest that however &#34;conventional&#34; the English murder mystery may have been, it was never as conventional as Hollywood.
