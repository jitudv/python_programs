What "improvements" have been made for the Berkley edition?  There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket.  There are further differences still in the Signet, Bantam, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions.  For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice.  What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them.  Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed.
