I thought that I'd love this book. I'm a huge fan of historical fiction, but this book pushed that interest and my attention span. Although Gregory writes fairly well, I found myself slogging through this book and wondering if it would ever end. As the book progresses, so does the detail given toward sexual matters in all aspects. The inclusion of these details didn't seem to further the plot any, but rather appeared as the gratuitous nudity, etc. sometimes thrown into movies just because. I didn't dislike this book, but it wasn't enjoyable either.
