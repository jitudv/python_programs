This is a story of Katherine of Valois, the daughter of Charles VI, whose grandson was the first King of Tudor dynasty.Katherine certainly had her share of unhappiness. Living in squalor with her brothers and sisters, while her mother, ignored her children and spend her time with her lovers instead. Her father appeared to have been a kind man but given to fits of madness which essentially took him out of picture as well. Despite all, Katherine grows up to be an educated and attractive woman. It was arranged that she marries King Henry V of England and surprisingly theirs was a love match(or as much love as Henry could give). Henry died suddenly and once again, Katherine is alone, with only her son to keep her company. After a few years, her advisers take over her son Henry upbringing and Katherine is only allowed to see him for short visits.Lonely and desolate, Katherine forms a friendship with Owen Tudor, one of the Welsh knights. Eventually, they fall in love and marry in secret.Overall, this is good historical book. There is couple of things that i want to comment on, however-Jean Plaidy's style of writing is really kind of like non-fiction historical book. Its a pretty easy read and i went through the whole book in couple of days. However, characters are really one dimentional, there is hardly any depth to them at all. Also, any details of everyday life, food, dress, customs are missing altogether which in my mind makes it more of a nonfiction historical narrative rather than a novel. Don't get me wrong-I liked the book but if you want richness of historical details you won't find it here.
