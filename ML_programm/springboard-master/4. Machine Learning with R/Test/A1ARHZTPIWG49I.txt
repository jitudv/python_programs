I've read King's Mary Russell series and enjoyed it, but Folly is  a much better piece of writing.  Where the Russell series is entertaining but light, Folly is a thoughtful investment with a complex main character.Being from the Northwest, I loved the setting on a small island in the Straits of Juan de Fuca.  But what I liked most was the use of an older woman as a protagonist.  Rae's a bit of an anomaly in our current sea of women's fiction. For starters, she's old.  Plus she's stubborn, smart, fit, and a bit paranoid.  And a grandmother.  Sometimes it's hard to connect with characters whose age and mindset feel vastly different than your own, but King makes Rae live and breathe and I really enjoyed her.  It's a very human portrayal and I could relate to her.  She's no superwoman.  Rae doesn't appreciate growing older.  She's used to being fully capable and you can tell how much it bothers her to have to take time with things and be careful with her body.  Her granddaughter Petra serves as a bit of an emotional safety line for her.  Excellently done.  The plot itself is good with the play on paranoia--how much is Rae imagining and how much is real?  But it's premise is a wee gothic.  Luckily, you don't really notice or question. An enjoyable weekend or week read.**If you like Folly, then you may be interested in Beachcombing for a Shipwrecked God by Joe Coomer.
