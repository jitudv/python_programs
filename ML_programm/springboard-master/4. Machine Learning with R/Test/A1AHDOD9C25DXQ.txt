I read this book many years ago, but a current Client asked me to re-read it prior to speaking in their organization as they are using its language and premises.  I'm glad I did.It is a business fable, in traditional Blanchard style that tells story that is good enough to keep you engaged to lead and remember through repetition the keys points to creating "raving fans."  While it may not be the best story of the books in this genre, it does illuminate important factors about doing more that satisfying Customers, but rather turning them into fans - a bar much higher than "satisfaction."Written in 1993, the subtitle is "A Revolutionary Approach to Customer Service."  While I'm not sure it is revolutionary 12 years later, it is still worth reading.  Consider this a great primer for Customer Service or a great book to encourage many to read because it is short and assessable even to those who don't read much.
