I didn't get this book until a couple weeks ago; I had read the earlier reviews, and I thought, wow, it (the book) has to be better than others wrote.  Well, having read the book now, I see a lot of validity in their comments.  To rehash what was written would be a waste, but, yes, no one of the main characters dies in this book; they all keep getting out of fixes that the author keeps getting them into.  It's almost like there is a commercial coming, so the author has to set up some difficult situation (only to be resolved down the road a bit).  Still, Martin does tell a good tale, and I am really liking the dwarf even if he did kill his father.  Martin shows Tyrion in numerous difficult situations and keeping his wits about him; still, with the plague all about them, it seems a bit much none of the leading characters catch anything. (I am, of course, only talking about the dragon queen portion of the book, not the Seven Kingdom majority of the book.  Arya Stark is a bit much at times with her stubbornness; most people would never have stayed blind once they realized they had the power to end it.  I don't think this book is as well written as some of the earlier ones, but it is still entertaining and worth a read.
