Hercule Poirot and Captain Hastings began their first renowned case together withThe Mysterious Affair at Styles (Hercule Poirot Mysteries (Audio)). And in their concluding encounter, Poirot's last case, the pair completes the circle, again teaming up at Styles Court (which is under new ownership) to ferret out a murderer.The old mansion of Styles is now a renovated boarding house run by an elderly couple and Poirot calls upon his life-long friend and Man Friday, Captain Hastings, to abet him in his final and most compelling case. Hasting's modernistic and independent daughter is also on the premises and the Captain's unwelcome exertions in attempting to sort out her future provides an appetizing sub-plot.One of the numerous residents of Styles is a serial killer and the motive for this murderer's heinous crimes remains unclear for a time. The solution to this one is a real zinger and Christie fans will certainly not be let down.This is a "Golden Age" classic British mystery in every sense, even though the book was published in 1975. The fact is that, doubting her own survival in the face of the endless World War Two conflagrations, Christie wrote this fine whodunnit in the early 1940s! The Poirot mystery which Christie last wrote (1972) wasElephants Can Remember (Hercule Poirot), and her final work (which featured Tommy and Tuppence Beresford) wasPostern of Fate, published in 1973. Agatha Christie died in 1976.Hugh Fraser reads this story from the first-person perspective of Captain Hastings. His reading and rhythm are just top-notch, as it is with all the Christie works which he has taken on. Prospective buyers should be aware that this title is also available with an alternative reader:Curtain: Complete & Unabridged: Poirot's Last Case. This edition is read by John Moffatt, another master of the art. Which one is best? I cannot say for anyone else but I prefer Fraser on this particular work but most folks will be pleased with either one.I really like the packaging on my Harpercollins audiobook, which is notably different than the one pictured. My CDs are securely housed in a clear, heavy plastic, music-type container and all five CDs are "stacked" inside, a method which I find preferable to the typical cardboard "slip cases" where each CD slides into a slot. If this is an issue, you might contact the seller in advance to see which packaging format s/he is offering. In any event, the total time for this unabridged audiobook is six hours and what a superb listening experience it is!There is little else to say except to reiterate that this is a terrific Hercule Poirot mystery that all Christie fans will want to hear time and again.
