I loved the first 3 books. This one was interesting in a way, but disappointing also. The introduction of the new characters, some from feast for crows, made me feel as if the author is just stretching the story, loose ends that hopefully will be tied up in book 6. I look forward to the new book, and hope that we won't have to wait so many years before we can continue reading it.It appears as if Jon Snow has been killed. I hope not, he is an interesting character, like his father, and the other members of the Stark family.
