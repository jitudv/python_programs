Tolkien's LOTR is the Ur-epic of English literature; it cannot be compared to standards of greatness because it is itself that standard.  More than simply a rousing adventure story (altho' it is that), more than a masterpiece of prose and imagination (altho' it is these things), it recaptures  forgotten memories of lost times and places and explores the realms of fantastic wonder as well as the subtle paths of the heart.  A terrible beauty.  Twenty-five years after my first exposure to its pages, it still weaves a spell, revealing new truths and insights with the passing of the days.  A gift from the Valar to bring us Home over the Western Sea.
