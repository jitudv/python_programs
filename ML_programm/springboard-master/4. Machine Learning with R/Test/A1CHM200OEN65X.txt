Bradbury, like Jules Verne, uses his fiction as a telescope to look far into the future.  Then, to remind us of the human element, his words become a microscope, looking deep into our minds and souls.  "The Illustrated Man" combines these tools with chilling effectiveness.Although Bradbury penned these tales over fifty years ago, they still ring with cautionary truth.  The prologue and epilogue work as bookends, holding in eighteen stories of apocalyptic and visionary wisdom.  Through the moving and shifting tattoos on the illustrated man's back, we see glimpses of the future, full of technology, greed, strife, and the human propensity for selfishness.  Collectively, these tales remind us that our relationships will always supercede our computers and rockets.  When these elements lose perspective, danger lurks in every corner.Although some of the stories seem dated, "The Illustrated Man" educates while it entertains.  Bradbury is a master of his craft, and this is a masterpiece of science fiction.
