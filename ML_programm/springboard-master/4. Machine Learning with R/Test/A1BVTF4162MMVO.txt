I did read another of his books - 'Cross' - and hated it, but this one is actually quite good. The plot tends to jump-cut a little sometimes and things have a habit of coming to slightly forced and convenient conclusions, but you do want to keep turning the pages. I disagree that this plot could have been dealt with in 500 words.  There were some nice little touches to the plot and good characterisation.  I didn't buy the ending much and found it too much of an exercise in tying up every loose end ther author could find.Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and would recommend it on the basis that it's an interesting, undemanding read: perhaps one to go for if you've just spent days ploughing through something a little more 'literary', which this sure isn't!!
