Obviously, the upcoming release of the new Lord of the Rings movies is prompting a lot of interest in this series, but this is not the typical trashy hollywood hype.  J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy ranks among the best works of literature ever produced.  Although it might seem like fantasy, Tolkien's work is actually deeply remnisciant of miedieval literature.  Tolkien himself spent his whole life as a respected scholar studying works such as &quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.&quot;  These were among the very first novels every concieved and they read like a explication of the early human intellectual mind.  Although we, as a society, have progressed far beyond this early stage, the echos of the emotions that moved these people still reside strongly in us.  Tolkien's genius was to isolate these emotions and exagurate them by adjusting what is primarilly an archetypical tale for a modern audience.  The Lord of the Rings is a creative masterpiece, many of the elements of the story are brilliantly concieved by Tolkien to maintain a seamless narrative structure.  But the component of the work that gives it it's greatest power is that delicate fragment, so meticulously preserved by Tolkien, that harkens back to the eve of humankind's intellectual development.  In a sense, The Lord of the Rings, is itself, a vast scholarly paper that seeks to recreate the wonder that must have been felt by early civilizations as they sat around the hearth and recounted the tales of &quot;Beowulf&quot; and so many others.  Tolkien's fantasy is indisputably the work of genius, but, contrary to most fantasy, it also contains a strong sense of compassion and understanding for the human condition.  This is not a tale to be missed.
