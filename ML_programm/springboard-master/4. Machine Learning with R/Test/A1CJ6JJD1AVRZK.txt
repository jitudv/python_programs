While Gogol is the central character in the novel, it is something of a character study of the parents as well. The name change is a metaphor for Gogol's evolution as an Indian-American wanting to be more of an American who is simply of Indian heritage. This is strikingly evident in his two main love interests who are like day and night. The writing is fluid and descriptive although sometimes oddly and awkwardly using passive present voice ("The book is seen by him as he turns around." as opposed to "He turned around and saw the book."). My main criticism, though, is the truly melancholy feeling about Gogol's relationships - whether it's with his father, his mother, his love interests - and how all of their stories end. I truly cared about the characters, but wished somehow things might have resolved in a more positive way. I'll push this from three and a half up to four stars for the wonderful insight of life of foreign nationals settling in America and the compelling storyline.
