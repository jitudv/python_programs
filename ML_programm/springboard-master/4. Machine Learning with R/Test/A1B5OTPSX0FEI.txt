I've owned this book for a long time (about 15 years) and have recently taken it out to reread. Even after having been read a number of times it still looks as good as new. Not that a little wear and tear wouldn't be good for this book. It's just one of those kind of books that actually gains character as it ages. As you can probably see, I am quite emotionally attached to this book, both the story of the Lord of the Rings and well as the actual physical book I own.  I believe this is the book Tolkien wanted to publish, and I can almost see Frodo hand-writing his story into it.I would maybe prefer it if the leather was a bit more brown, and that the golden scrolls on the cover were a bit deeper and wider, but on the whole I love it and definitely recommend it to all fans of Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings. I am also certain that the cover is made of genuine, high quality leather.
