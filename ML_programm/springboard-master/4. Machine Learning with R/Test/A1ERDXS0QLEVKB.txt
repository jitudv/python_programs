At the conclusion of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; you are left in suspense and you are craving what's to come next. &quot;The Two Towers&quot; will get you over your suspense a little, but at the end of this second installment of &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; you'll be left in more suspense that you were at the conclusion of &quot;Fellowship.&quot;The first half of this book centers on Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn as they come about a big point in the book that will leave you feeling very happy. Don't worry, I won't tell you what that thing is. The Fellowship still remains split up and some things that you wanted to know at the conclusion of the last book are revealed, as said above. That is as much as I'll tell you for this book because if I tell you anymore the book will be ruined for you.As in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; J.R.R. Tolkien gives you luscious descriptions and phenomonal writing. He goes into some matters that were brought forth in the first book with such skill that only Tolkien could pull off. At the end of this book you will feel a craving to pick up &quot;The Return of the King&quot; right away.&quot;The Two Towers&quot; is the second book in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and the best of the first two volumes. Tolkien brings you into his beautiful world that you won't be able to get enough of. Before delving into this, be sure to read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; first so you won't feel like you're reading material that makes no sense to you. I recommend this book to a fantasy fan or somebody that is looking for an adventurous, grand fantasy epic. Be sure to read this novel.Happy Reading!
