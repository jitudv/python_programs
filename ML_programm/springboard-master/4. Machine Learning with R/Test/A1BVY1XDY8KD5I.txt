Oh, man. I loved this book. It is laugh out loud funny from start to finish. I can't believe I'm the first to review it. This is one chick lit author to watch. I have got to get my hands on the next book now (Theodora's Wedding). I want to know more about this quirky character and her friends and neighbors.
