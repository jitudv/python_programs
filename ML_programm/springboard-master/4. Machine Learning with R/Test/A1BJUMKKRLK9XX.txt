This is a good book. It covers mind mapping briefly. It could have been even more brief, but for the rather outlandish claims of its author. Tony Buzan is given to a lot of exaggeration. Shorn of the inflated claims, the book could well have been a small and effective booklet.The subject of the book is worthy of learning and usage. Mind mapping offers a very easy technique that requires little more than color pens and paper (though rather expensive software is also available). The method is simple -- a central topic in the middle, followed by radiating branches denoting concepts, sub-concepts, and further conceptual breakdowns. Arranging information spatially rather than linearly as in to-do lists and written notes helps place each node of information in context, and also helps the brain "grok" the entire picture all at once.One thing I find surprising about Buzan's book is -- why did he not mind-map his book itself? It would have been much easier to understand the concepts that way.I would recommend that you purchase the book by Joyce Wycoff rather than this one. The former book contains some good examples of mind maps and its applications.For those inclined to using software, FreeMind is an excellent freeware application that helps one create mind maps.
