I am not an expert on the subcontinent, and I found this book to be well written and gripping. It ties together events occurring at nearly the same time, so the reader gets a feeling for the huge tragedy that overtook India. I had read Paul Scott's The Raj Quartet and Staying On, which are fictional accounts of the Partition. This book filled in many of the historical details that serve as backdrop for the Scott novels. I like that this book does not glamourize the English Raj, many of whom were clerks elevated to masters in the British India. It does seem more negative toward Jinnah and the Muslims than the Hindus, but I do not yet know whether this is a fair depiction. The Sikhs come off very badly. It succeeds in inspiring the reader to seek out more facts about India and Pakistan.
