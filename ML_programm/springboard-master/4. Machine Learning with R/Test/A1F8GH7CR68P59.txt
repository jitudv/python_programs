Does that mean Gandalf was more than wise? As he defended gollum "Not all those who are alive deserve to be alive, not all those who are dead deserve death, but can we give life to them? So do not be too quick to take it away - for not even the wise see all ends." But it is my reading of the story that the nobility of Frodo would never have achieved the mission (although he would get close), the innocence of Sam would be insufficient too (although he could get even closer), something else was needed and gollum was vital to that completion. I believe the film-makers missed this, so if you have only seen the films I recommend you read Tolkein's words too - it will take a while, but what a journey of the imagination it is.It took me a long while to read through these novels as a bedside reading for my older son (I skipped the chapter on Shelob as just too scary!). I had read the novels many years earlier, not once but twice. And once again, as I read that last chapter - which isn't directly about death - the tears were hard to suppress so that I could keep the words flowing.I guess endings are always like that - especially endings to really big things in our lives.Recommended other reading:The Hobbit  - JRR TolkienTitus Groan - Mervyn PeakeThe Place of the Lion - Charles WilliamsOut of the Silent Planet - CS Lewis
