Rather than reviewing Lord of the Rings, which has been done many times by many people with a finer grasp of describing the wonder of the best book of the twentieth century than I, I shall remain content to say that this boxed set is neatly presented with Alan Lee's fine artwork on the outside. Many readers will find copies of Tolkien get rapidly dog-eared from frequent use so to have a box set that can be kept in a prominent place on the shelf is nice. It is also well-priced for its new design.
