A Dance with Dragon is a sprawling tome of epic proportions that further expands the A Song of Ice and Fire universe but does not provide any resolutions to the plethora of dangling plot threads from the previous books. It helped reading Dance with Dragons on the heels of A Feast for Crows since gave me a clearer picture of the parallel story arc. Yet with so many pending questions, cliffhangers, resurrections, and prophecies, A Dance with Dragons felt  fragmented and unfocused. I was especially frustrated that Dany and her dragons seem to be perpetually stuck in political quagmire. I really hope with the next book that Dany and the dragons get moving, I'm sick to death of the stagnant Meereen storyline. I want to know who will ride the three dragons for the second dance with dragons.Nevertheless, I found myself fully engrossed with the intrigues of the feudal medieval world of Westeros and it was good to see some favorites characters again. I especially enjoyed the aftermath of scheming, power-hungry Cersei's public humiliation and I was blown away with the revelations of Varys true motivation. At this point, there are still a handful of characters left that I hope and root for (Daenerys, Bran, Jon Snow, Aegon, Arya, and Davos). I also want to stick around in case the Lannisters, Boltons, and Freys will get their comeuppance sooner rather than later. Now I join the long line of waiters for the sixth book in the series, The Winds of Winter, and hope that the next book will move towards a coherent, ultimate ending.
