It is difficult to believe that the writer of "Interpreter of Maladies" is the same as the author of this novel. The book starts off interestingly enough, describing Gogol's(the main character)  parents, their arranged marriage in Calcutta, and their emigration to America. We then fly through his birth, school years and college years as if the author was in a race to get to the more "juicy" bits of the character's lives. The book then becomes sort of a soap opera, with the characters falling into one cliched scene after another. Hopefully Lahiri's next effort will return to the quality of her prize winning first book.
