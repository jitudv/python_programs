This action packed story uses several unusual premises to move the story forward.  The otherworldly demon moving through space, devouring world populations as it goes was a nice touch.  The princess hides out with 6 highly trained horses and they are used imaginatively many times during her journey to seek aid for her people.  Without the horses, I might not have finished the book.  Mykkael the paragon of virtue and strength began to wear on me by the end of the story.  I was relieved to see something good happen for him at last.  The strangely formal language was heavily burdened with useless adjectives , many of them used again and again(if I ever see the words "desert bred" in print again, I may burn the book).  In spite of my problems with the writing style, I enjoyed the book immensely and will probably keep an eye out for more by this author.
