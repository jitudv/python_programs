I was looking forward to a good popularization of Fuzzy Logic theory, but I am quite disappointed.This is not a science book, nor is it a popularization of science. What science it does contain is unclear, is not presented in laymen's terms, and in some cases is factually wrong. The author asserts, pg. 107, that E = mc^2 is an approximation of a nonlinear equation, and attempts to prove it by pointing out where Einstein makes an approximation in his 1905 paper. It turns out that he was taking the Newtonian limit of an equation, and the limit implies the famous E=mc^2, but the E=mc^2 is not itself an approximation. This isn't a particularly serious error, and in fact he would have been technically correct until he said that the famous equation itself was an approximation. It is a sign of Kosko's attitude when he asserts that &quot;[e]ven many physicists forget&quot; that Einstein did this.I do not doubt that fuzzy logic is useful, but this is not a useful primer from which to learn first principles. Rather it is a diatribe against &quot;Aristotalean logic&quot;. Einstein's work, to use him as an example again, was impressive because it was it turned out to be correct to a high degree of precision, not because Newton's work was wrong. Einstein's attitude towards his work was &quot;Hey look at what I found!&quot; not &quot;Can you believe this Newton guy? He got it all wrong!&quot;The author tries to unite philosophy and science and fuzzy logic and politics into one book, and fails utterly. His presentation of each of these topics detracts from the others. Douglas R. Hofstadter's classic &quot;Godel, Escher, Bach : An Eternal Golden Braid&quot; does this much better, in a far classier manner, and addresses quite clearly the &quot;mapping problem&quot; (as Kosko calls it) between logical systems and using them to describe the real world.Fuzzy math is a clever mathematical device, and turns out to be very useful for engineering automatic computer controls for systems with several degrees of freedom, but you don't even learn this until the second half of the book, right before he dreams of applications of fuzzy logic to politics. Those who subscribe to the view that the &quot;black-and-white&quot; judgmentalism of science is a bad thing may enjoy the philosophical combativeness of this book, but even they will not learn anything new.No, I do not recommend this book even in the slightest degree, except as an example of how not to write a popular science book.
