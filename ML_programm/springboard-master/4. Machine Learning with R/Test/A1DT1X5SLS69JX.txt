I found this book entertaining despite the romance novel devices. Anne Boleyn fans beware - this is not a multi-dimensional portrayal of the historical figure. This Anne is more Scarlett O'Hara or Becky Sharp - willing to use anybody and suffer anything to achieve her ambitions. She does have a few vulnerable moments that make her sympathetic occasionally, but mainly she is a foil to Mary's blondness and relative niceness (the historical Mary Boleyn's alleged sexual escapades are toned down or omitted in this novel). This Anne is far more bitchy than spiritual or charitable - but of course that's why the book is so popular. After all, several enduring novels use this classic device of one nice girl and one nasty one and the sibling rivalry makes this story all the more emotional.Mary narrates the story, so that could excuse some of the negative portrayal of Anne. They are both rivals for the king's attention and rivals for their parents' affections. The coldness of the parents and Uncle Norfolk make the closeness between the three siblings George, Anne and Mary all the more poignant. George is charming and witty in this novel, Anne is self-centered and witty, and Mary is the romantic heroine, but she is not totally likeable. Before she defies her family to marry for love, she repeatedly betrays Queen Katharine by spying on her and seducing the king right in front of her - then she grovels before Katherine and declares how much she enjoys serving her. She knows she's a little hypocrite - she repeatedly uses snake imagery to describe herself and her relatives. My favorite line is: "George and I smiled encouragingly, the Boleyn smile: a pair of pleasant snakes."The author used many of the more controversial theories from Retha Warnicke's biography of Anne Boleyn as historical background, rather than a more well rounded and historically accurate sampling - but it made an entertaining story. The relationship between the 3 siblings is what kept me reading: perhaps closer than is healthy, but understandable considering their awful parents. This novel should have made a great movie due to the lurid story and historical characters - it is just a shame that neither of the movies made picked up on any of George's, Anne's or even Mary's charm - that is what really makes me want to read the book again.Now for the bad. First, Some of the dialogue is incredibly annoying unless you like romance novels. The siblings repeatedly call each other "silly whore" and stuff like that to excess, more like modern reality show trash than young Tudor aristocrats. Second, most of the other characters are one dimensional: The family elders are all self-serving, ambitious and cold with no redeeming traits whatsoever. The king is a spoiled brat, and the queen is pious and regal, but you don't find out much about her inner mind - she is developed in another book by the author. Mary's second husband is just too good to be true: he never loses his temper, super lover, super stepfather, helps deliver his own child, etc. etc. Oh, her kids are perfect little angels too. Third, I do have a respect for history and I would have preferred a more factual story, although that didn't stop me from enjoying this book. The queen committing incest with her brother - come on, most people understand that the incest charge was always used against top ranking females when they wanted to ensure a death verdict (witness Marie Antoinette) and historians have proven to most people's satisfaction that the incest charge against Anne was trumped up. I think the story would have been just fine without that prurient scene, since not very believable in fact.All in all, a very enjoyable story if read purely as entertainment.
