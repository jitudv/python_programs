I actually liked A Dance with Dragons more than any since A Game of Thrones. Finally, I've learned to ignore the many knights, crows, guards, etc., who have little to do with the main plot and concentrate on the main characters. Yes, the book hasn't moved very far along, but this wasn't expected with 7 books planned. I found myself rooting for characters to succeed and shocked at the fate of several. There are quite a few cliffhangers in this book, with some resolved several chapters later and some awaiting their fate in the next novel.I started this series back in November and have read all five in the months since. As in the case of any series, it's difficult to wait for the next book. However, there are good summaries online that help refresh and also an app for Game of Thrones with maps, places, and characters. I also plan to watch the DVD of the HBO series when it comes out.
