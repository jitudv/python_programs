I enjoyed this book because it describes a fascinating world, but I agree with the other reviewers: there was no need to bring in the characters from Earth. Kay would have done well enough just talking about Fionavar. Also, I found it odd that the characters from Earth adjusted to life on Fionavar so easily, as if they hadn't lived their entire lives in a completely different dimension. Before the start of the action in the book, they are just like you and me, and they've certainly never imagined that there are any worlds other than Earth. But when Loren Silvercloak comes for them, they take him at his word and go with him with barely a murmur. When they're on Fionavar, there's hardly a hint that they were ever anything else. Kim, especially, who must have slaved for years to become a doctor, abandons her hard-earned skills completely to embrace her new calling as a wizard. But these are rookie mistakes. As Kay's masterpiece "Tigana" proves, he only got better with time, and even in this, his first book, he shows the promise of story-telling mastery that would later be realized.
