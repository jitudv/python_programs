I just heard Amy Tan speak at a conference this weekend, and I can't say enough about this articulate, funny and spiritual writer. In Bonesetter's Daughter, she dealves even deeper into her oftentimes troubled relationship with her mother and the overwhelming tragic influence of her Chinese past on her family. An important exploration into the women's experiences in China, it is also a study of human emotion and its heritage for future generations. Amy Tam began this book at her mother's exhortions to tell her &quot;true story&quot;. In the aftermath of her experiences in the last moments of her mother's life, Amy Tam revised the whole focus. A true story of the heart.
