Dust digs its hooks into you right from the beginning...This fantastical story with its twists and turns kept me captured, but did make me feel like I'd missed something. It was easy to read, and well written. It reminded me of Stephen King stories (great company), but without the horror and complexity. Very much worth a read, but not more than once.
