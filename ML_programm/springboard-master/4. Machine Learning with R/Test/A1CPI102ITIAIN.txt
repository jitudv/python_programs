The first three books in this series are a wonderful reinvention of a tired genre, the epic fantasy novel. Many have compared Martin to Tolkein in the process, and it's true that they have each invented a complete Otherworld, real and yet alien, filled with acutely realized characters.But Martin stumbled in Book Four, and falls in this, Book Five in the series.There's some good here. Thankfully, Tyrion is back, and Arya continues to be a complex and enigmatic character. Some of the intrigue on the Wall, with winter falling, is gripping. When the dragons eventually appear, they are as fearsome as dragons should be.But much of the rest of this book is dull nonsense (please fans, don't flame me!). It goes on, and on, and on, and on. I skipped pages of filler. Many of the plot-turns feel false and hurried. In the final chapters the book falls apart. There are so many incidental characters it becomes pointless to try and follow the numerous sub-plots that in any event aren't interesting. I could go on, but I'd be committing Martin's sin of saying far too much over and over again.What happened, Mr Martin???
