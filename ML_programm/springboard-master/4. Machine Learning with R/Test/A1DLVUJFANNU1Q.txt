The Bureau sends Quiller to Bangkok to protect an important British official who will be visiting Thailand.  Quiller approaches the job in his usual efficient (albeit grouchy) style, but finds himself outsmarted ... at least for awhile.Quiller is a well-defined character:  independent, even anti-social, perhaps suffering from a (perhaps justified) superiority complex.  The other characters are more like caricatures, but the enjoyment of this novel comes from the intricate, twisty plot and from Quiller himself as he tries to out-think his adversary.  Quiller is an intellectual spy, but there's plenty of action to offset the thinking and scheming.  Fans of espionage/thriller novels should enjoy this.
