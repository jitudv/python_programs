My oldest daughter started checking out Agatha Christie novels from the library.  She says they are cool.  She left a couple books in the van last week.  I brought them in and started reading Partners in Crime.Partners in Crime is a collection of short stories tied together with an overall story arc.  The partners are a husband and wife team who solve mysteries.  Tommy and Tuppence Beresford are asked by the Secret Service to take over a detective agency in an effort to flush out a master spy.  The Beresfords agree.  As detectives they have several adventures.  Every chapter or couple chapters has a single mystery.  With the last chapter being when they capture the master spy that no one else had been able to get a handle on.The stories take place in the early 1900's in England.  The mysteries happen at various locations and different levels of society.  I figure my daughter is learning a little bit of history as she reads these stories.They are fun.  If you haven't read an Agatha Christie book before, this is a good place to start.
