I came to The Liveship Trilogy from the Farseer and Tawny Man trilogies. This is actually a sidestep between those two that takes place in the same world but in another region. Only one character from the other two trilogies is involved in this story yet all of it weaves together to form a 9 book series. If I had not had the luxury of choosing to skip from Farseer to Tawny Man in order to stay with Fitz Chivalry I would have read everything in sequence......which I now see is the best way though not essential. Hobb has skillfully written the trilogies so that you need not venture to the Liveship series in order to maintain continuity. Having initially skipped to Tawny Man I did not feel anything was missing. Enough information was provided to fill any potential gaps. However, this is not to suggest that anything in the Liveship trilogy is not worth reading. This series stands on its own as well as fits together with the other two. It is an emotionally gripping tale full of characters you will learn to love. Fortunately this one ends leaving room to continue in a future story. Where Tawny picks up and ends does not define where Liveship could go. I do not regret the order I read them in because I needed to stay with Fitz Chivalry's story at the time. The design of each tolerates such a sequence. But Ideally, do yourself a favor and read the sequence in order from Farseer to Liveship to Tawny Man so you can gain the most from this wonderful tale.
