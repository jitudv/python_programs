First, the obvious. Martin takes way too much time to write these books. By the time the next one comes, I've completely forgotten everything but the major plot points. It takes about half of the book to start remembering who is who and what is what. A Song of Ice and Fire is just too dark of a series to go back and reread the first four books to get back up to (slow) speed.Martin spends lots of time in this book making characters do precisely nothing. Yes, it's well written, yes it does keep you mostly interested, but by the end of the book, you wonder why you read it. Nobody progressed much of anything with regards to the story.The worst part is that at least one really cool thing does happen -- finally. But then near the end of the book, Martin pretty much takes it all back again signalling that it will have to re-happen sometime in a far future book. The one word I would use to describe this book is frustrating.ASoIaF is a must read, but it's also amazingly difficult to do so.
