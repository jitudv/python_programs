i love the LOTR trilogy, it stands as one of my favorite books. even the movies are great capturing every single detail of Mr. Tolkeins books. the story is about Frodo Baggins who sets out o a quest to destroy the evil and hated one ring forged by the dark lord Sauron. along the way people join him on his quest and form the fellowship of the ring. then in the second book the fellowship has been broken, Frodo and Sam continue on to Mt. Doom, Aragorn and company try to save Pippen and Mary, then Aragorn must help the land of Rohan which is underattack by the now cursed tower of Isengard. then in the final book Frodo, Sam, and Gollum reach Mordor, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Gandalf, Mary, and Pippen prepare for the battle of Minis Tirith. the end is great and well written. read this truly astounding book
