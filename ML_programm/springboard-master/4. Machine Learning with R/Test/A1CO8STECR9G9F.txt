King's newest novel is everything that the other reviewers claim, good and bad. (Except that it's NOTHING like Mary Higgins Clark, whose works I had to ban from my Women's Murder Mystery class after finding them 98% romance and 2% mystery.)  But in &quot;Folly,&quot; King does use obvious symbolism, long digressions, unexpected and non-chronological flash-backs, bleeds a bit into romance, and lacks a clear articulation or resolution of the immortal &quot;who dunnit?&quot;  Or at least &quot;why?&quot;But it is a very good book.Unlike the books of her Kate Martinelli series or Mary Russell series, King's newest novel is only incidentally a mystery, although almost none her other books are _simply_ mysteries.  But in &quot;Folly&quot; there's certainly fearful suspense artfully manipulated and enough problems to be solved to provide a satisfactory, if not perfectly neat resolution.  The plot's chronology is complexly presented, so it's no book to read when you have to put it down for a day then pick it up for thirty minutes before bedtime.  But the focus on single and mutably complex main character (however unfortunately allegorical her name) justifies that.While I am a great fan of King's work, I wouldn't claim that she can't write a less-than-wonderful book -- see &quot;To Play the Fool&quot; or &quot;The Moor,&quot; a book that gave me an even worse headache than the Dorothy L. Sayers' exercise with Scottish fish and train timetables.  But this book IS, in many ways, wonderful.  The metaphor of a woman rebuilding herself as she rebuilds a house may be as obvious as &quot;new born&quot; and &quot;sanctuary,&quot; but that doesn't make it any less compelling -- see Homer or Virgil or Dante, also writers with obvious controlling metaphors.  The point is that the metaphor works, and as it works, becomes something larger than a simple comparison.King's sense of place is exquisitely portrayed here.  Not just the island upon which Rae lives, but the whole eco-system of the San Juan's is a feast for the reader.  She makes a world I'd want to walk into, making it real with attention to plants and rocks and birds and mud, and the ebb and flow of wind and water, as well as with the larger outlines and the more ambiguous ambience of a community made up of islands and a population both dependent on and resentful of tourists.  But aside from Rae, the island itself is the main character, and one of King's most interesting characters.  Here I'm reminded of Mary Stewart's early novels that blend mystery, travelogue, and (yes) romance so effectively that, reading them as a teen, I fell in love with those settings, a love that out-lasted my memory of the characters or plots.  Visiting Delphi, Avignon and environs, the Isle of Skye as an adult, I've met other women travelers who were there for the same reason.  King's islands have that effect, making me seriously consider a trip to that area -- something entirely new for me.So it's a book that can metamorphose the reader in many ways.  The subject of depression -- which I'd dreaded after reading the reviews -- is actually affirmative as King crafts it in the struggle of Rae.  And the art and love of wood is an unexpected but powerful gift that the book brings to the reader with world enough and time.
