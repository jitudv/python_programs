Thuis book is as all of his other books a true masterful tale of intrigue.  I simply had to find out how he was going to end the book, he did not let me down.  I was hooked and could not put this thriller down.  another un-down-putable book. The pro is Jack Higgins.  Another great job!  Another winner.
