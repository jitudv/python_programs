I can't understand how many people hate this book! I find it extremely entertaining, suspenseful, exciting, and I'm not "illiterate", nor am I a "12 year-old". I think some people take these books way too seriously! Was I wrong in thinking that books were all about losing yourself in the story? I'll admit some things in the story annoyed me, but that happens with every book. I have enough of reality everyday, I like a little unrealistic getaway every now and again. If you want to be entertained and just forget about reality for a while, I definitely recommend James Patterson.
