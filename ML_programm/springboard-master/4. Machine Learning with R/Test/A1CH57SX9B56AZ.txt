I read this book in one day because I simply could not put it down. It is a great story about the healing power of forgiveness with understanding.  Anyone who has a tough relationship with a parent will commiserate with the main character, Ruth Young, and after finishing the story, will be left wondering about the circumstances that shaped their own parent's faults. Entertaining and thought provoking.
