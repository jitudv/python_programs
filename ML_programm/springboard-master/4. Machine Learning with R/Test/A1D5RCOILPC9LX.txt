This book turned out to be not at all what I was expecting. Shelved in with the mystery/thrillers, and boasting a creepy title, it sounded like it would be an exciting, suspenseful story with a strong focus on plot. Instead, the book really focused on character redemption. The narrator was quite likable, and some of his interior monologue actually made me laugh out loud. And while Pyper created an eerie atmosphere, his over-use of nightmares to create that spooky tone became quite frustrating after a while. The role of "villain" was very loosely applied here, and none of the characters really fulfilled that part. I enjoyed Pyper's writing style, and though it did not meet my expectations, it was certainly a unique sort of novel. It started out very strongly, and unfortunately, that strength did not carry through the entire novel. It had some definite high points though, so I would not be averse to reading another one of his books, but I won't be rushing out to purchase more either.
