I've first read this book in high school, and this is one of the very few books I liked then and still like now! This is not a traditional Agatha Christie book, where a &quot;detective&quot; comes into the picture to  inverstigate a crime which was already a done deed, and comes along to find  the suspect. You see the crime being commited right before your eyes,  and  are aware of what everyone feels and thinks.
