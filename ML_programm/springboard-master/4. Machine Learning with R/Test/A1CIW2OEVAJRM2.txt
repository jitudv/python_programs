Because of Tolkien's reputation as a master story-teller, I began reading this book with absurdly high expectations.  The slow beginning confirmed my suspicions that such high expectations could not possibly be realistic, and I prepared myself to be gloriously disappointed.  Quite honestly, by the end of the first chapter I shared the opinion of the protagonist, the hobbit: I was rather unenthusiastic, and doubtful that the "adventure" which lay ahead could truly be as exciting as it promised to be.But Tolkien rarely disappoints.  Within pages, along with our hobbit hero, Bilbo Baggins, I found myself launched into the famous fantasy world that is the product of Tolkien's imagination, a world of never-ending adventure, mystery and magic.  As I joined the hobbit on his remarkable quest to defeat the dragon Smaug and reconquer the dwarves long-lost treasure, I met a wonderful array of friends and foes - wizards, dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins, and a myriad of other fantastic creatures - and my imagination and interest never waned.By the end of the hobbit's adventure, like Bilbo, I was thoroughly satisfied.  At the conclusion, the wizard Gandalf remarks to the hobbit: "My dear Bilbo!  Something is the matter with you!  You are not the hobbit that you were."  Yet it was not only the hobbit that had changed as a result of this adventure.  As a reader, I had to confess that I too had changed.  My initial lack of enthusiasm had entirely vanished.  I had participated in the hobbit's adventures, and like him, returned the better for it.  Tolkien's imaginative world is a world so vivid, that you cannot fail to return to the real world a changed person.  His descriptive abilities cannot fail to imprint his imaginary world in your memory.  This story is not deep, but it is delightful and unforgettable.  And like the hobbit, you will return to life the better having read it.What's more, you can go "there and back again" again, and again, because the joy of this fantastic adventure won't quickly wear off.  For all ages, this book is eminently readable and re-readable, and belongs on every bookshelf.  Don't miss it, because you will miss one of the most enchanting escapes that literature has to offer.
