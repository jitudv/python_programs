Transport yourself into the time of King Henry VIII!!  I felt like a fly on the wall, or at least one of the courtesans watching this drama unfold.It's an amazing story, and told best here.  How the women of the era wove their way through through the power, greed and deception is fascinating!  I couldn't put it down...my BOOK CLUB loved this book also!  It does not disappoint and I felt like I was learning something about the time period as the "fact" blend seamlessly with the fiction!ENJOY!!
