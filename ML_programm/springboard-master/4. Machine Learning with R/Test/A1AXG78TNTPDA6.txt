Well I finally finished this volumus book.  Even though it took me all  summer it was fantastic.  Tolkein is the master of the fantasy and this  novel is easily the best one written.  Those some times tedious in details  of every event you are drawn into the novel from the first page.  If you  have the time read this, you will not be disappointed.
