Of course I will not regurgitate the sweet plot of J.R.R. Tolkien's great novels, The Lord of the Rings.  If there's any criticism it's that the volume does not have The Hobbit, but that's a minor quibble.But why get this book?Unlike the little paperbacks, this thick volume not only has all three books into one volume, it has large type and holds easily in the hands.  After you have visited the Two Towers and have scoured the Shire, it's time to dive into the Appendices.Wow, this a great!  Tolkien clearly put a lot of work into creating this world of fantasy.  We have the legends and history and lore of Middle Earth, starting with the Annals of the Kings and Rulers, the Numenorean Kings, the Heirs of Isildur and the Kings of the Mark (and so on, and so on).Drooling yet?There is a chronology of events in the later appendices which makes a reread of the stories make more sense (at least for me).  A brief mention of The First Age, the dark years of the Second Age, and a thorough working of the Third Age -- it's as if this world actually existed, complete with its own history and events.Turn the page and observe the genealogy of the Baggins of Hobbiton, Brandybuck of Buckland, what a Shire Calendar looks like and how to work out the dates, the pronunciation of words and names, writings and spelling.  Heck, learn the "Feanorian" alphabet!A complete index of all three novels, including the songs and verses, the first lines of the songs and verses, references for all persons, beasts and monsters and so on.You get the idea.  Extensive!The book was printed at the time of the Peter Jackson films and so will have photos and the New Line Cinema logo on the cover.Reread Tolkien's masterpiece all in one easy-to-read volume.Recommended!
