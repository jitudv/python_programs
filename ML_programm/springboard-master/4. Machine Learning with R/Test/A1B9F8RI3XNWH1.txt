Ship of Magic and the Liveship Trader series are one of the most innovative fantasy series I have read in a long time.  Robin Hobb's choice of a maritime setting for her work (a setting that feels vaguely like the Caribbean, with an immigrant-type history) is very unusual and extremely well-rendered.  She obviously knows a lot about ships and shipboard life and renders the day to day minutiae of life on board a sailing ship extremely well.  She also does a good job of portraying the Bingtown society as a society in flux, with a clash and struggle between the old-time, established residents and the newcomers who are unfamiliar with the old ways of doing things.  Her depiction of the Vestrit family's struggles at home to make ends meet is very well-rendered and believable, and I was struck by the realism and thought put into her society (one example might be the fact that a lot of the old families are having problems making ends meet, caused by cheap Chalcedonian grain produced with slave labor being dumped on the market--an unusually realistic problem and explanation).  Her characterization feels excellent too--watching the Vestrit family essentially hit the wall in the first hundred or so pages, the people feel like real characters, and one is forced to admit that really, things couldn't have been done much differently, given the character make-up of the people involved.  The liveships are a great concept, and Paragon, the mad ship, is one of the most interesting characters in the whole series; his history is unexpectedly pitiable and touching.  Some people have considered this similar to Anne McCaffery's brain/brawn ships (The Ship who Sang, etc.) and while I guess I can see the resemblance, for some reason they didn't seem at all similar to me; perhaps it's just because her liveships seem so heavily to come out of a maritime tradition where sailing ships are regarded as living things, where Anne McCaffery is drawing more from a science fiction milieu involving cybernetics etc.  She does a remarkable job with the character of the pirate captain Kennit as well, I thought, with a character who is totally loathsome and utterly amoral and without any human feeling at all, but who is able to be ascribed these qualities by people around him who wish to see him as a symbol.  While I never liked Kennit, I was very impressed by what she was doing with him.  Wintrow's spiritual strength and strength of conviction were impressively done, and Malta the spoiled daughter is an impressive character also.  I was particularly interested in Malta because I have seen others try to create this type of character and fail to make him/her convincing; however, Malta was convincing.  Obviously her source of power is her knowledge of human relationships and her ability to manipulate people and use diplomacy.  However, unlike some other characters of this type I have seen, there is never any doubt in my mind (and I mean that in a good way) that Malta can manifest such power.  Right from the start she displays herself as extremely good at spotting people's actual motivations and using her knowledge to manipulate them, and while at first she uses her power for evil instead of good, because she doesn't know any better, by the end of the series she has matured and grown into a sympathetic and formidable character.On the negative side, the series has a few too many plotlines--the plotline with the serpents, for example, was one that I honestly felt I could have done without--and the prose style seemed a little thin at times.  However, for a truly different and interesting story, this is extremely well done.
