This is the first book I have read by Agatha Christie and I can see why it is a classic of the murder mystery genre. Christie managed to make me suspect pretty much all of the characters at some point in the book...brilliantly done! However, like a lot of mystery novels, I'm not sure if there would be a very high re-read value.
