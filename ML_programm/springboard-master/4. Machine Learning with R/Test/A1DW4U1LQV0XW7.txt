The LOTR trilogy is fantastic. But more on that in a moment, first a note about this three-book hardcover version (with the off-white covers). It was impossible for me to choose which edition I wanted, and I settled on this one. I was very disappointed when--despite Amazon's description--it is not illustrated by Alan Lee. There are no illustrations except Tolkien's from the original text. Otherwise, though, this is a good, durable, convient for reading, individual hardcover set. The hardcovers are a good size for reading.First time reading this since I saw the movie, second time reading.A classic of the genre that started too many clich&eacute;s of that genre. The characters are pretty flat and much of it is simplistic and silly and incredibly tedious and often confusing (hence where the films succeed with loving care). And yet, it's still wonderful. Clever and imaginative, and frankly, just stunningly beautiful in the richness of the language and the (epic) poetry of the descriptions, details, moods, and feelings. The idea of the littlest, humblest creature being in possession of great, tempting evil and his epic journey to carry the burden through a falling world in order to destroy it. Just simply fantastic storytelling with a loving appreciation for the power of words.The books get darker and richer as they move on, reflecting a deep appreciation for the reality under the fantasy--the reality of the burdens within heroism, of the darkness and oppression of evil, the grim emotions of loss and longing, a understanding of the bonds of friendship. Tolkien's epic is filled with beautiful imagery (Faramir's dreams, the dead marshes, the old forests, and most importantly, the weight of the Ring) that bring together simple (and therefore more powerful) magical fantasy with empirical reality.The last book is the best of the trilogy, rich in poetic feelings of bittersweet triumph, the sorrow and ever-lasting suffering of heroism, the renew of beauty and life in a world almost destroyed by ash and shadow, but a world that will never forget the darkness, the sadness of innocence lost and pastoral paradise that can never be returned to, and the deep bonds and devotion of friendship. Ultimately, the theme of these beautifully written epic books is that the smallest, unlikeliest person can be the grandest hero, as long as he does the best he can when fate deals him a difficult hand. And fate will deal us monstrous duties, but we must become the hero. Also, evil is evil, as is power, and it cannot be used for good. It will corrupt and destroy everything. Tolkien's beautiful poetry describes this with simple and stunning power.
