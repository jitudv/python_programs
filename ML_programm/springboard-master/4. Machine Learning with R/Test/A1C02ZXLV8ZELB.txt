This is one of the best fantasy series ever written. Reading originals is so much more gratifying than movies.It covers the whole gamut of emotions and is action from start to finish with good triumphing over evil, while being clean all the way through.There's never a dull moment, although the first time I read it 30 years ago, it did take me several starts to get into the swing of the book # 1.
