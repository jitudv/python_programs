I loved the first three books.  I was hoping the 4th was a fluke, but after finally getting through a Dance with Dragons I am bored.  I actually couldn't read more than one chapter without falling asleep.  I feel like half of this book could have been cut out and still gotten to the same ending point.  I would love to know how the story ends, but I don't think I can get through another book like this without knowing when the end is.
