I cannot say enough as to how this memoir by Ernest Gordon has impacted me.  Ernest took a horrifying situation and because of the love and charity and help from two fellow inmates was given the hope and will to survive what most likely would have been his death.  As he recovered from many ailments he went on to give to others what had been so selflessly given to him.  This was truly 'paying it forward' and making lemonade out of lemons.  I have always had faith and hope, but as we all face life challenges, think about the angels on Earth as evidenced in Ernest's story and you, too, will be able to see light on the darkest of days.  This will be a book I pass along to many and also one I will read again and again.  Ernest Gordon lived and survived for a reason and when you read this book, you will see why.
