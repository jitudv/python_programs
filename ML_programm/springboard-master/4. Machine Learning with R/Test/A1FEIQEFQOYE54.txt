More of the same awsome story, with even more complicated characters and incomplete cliff hangers and head scratching moments. But after all that....is it worth reading if its going to take 4 years from the time this book was written to the time book 6 comes out? AND another 4 to 5 years before book 7. Me personally will have to re-read before getting the next one as these stories are so complicated i will have forgotten most of the &#34;details&#34;. If you havent started the series i would say wait,if you have well then get your fix and wait like the rest of us hungry suffering dogs.
