It is not often you see this many reviews all of which are 5 stars so when one does you pretty much know that this is a special book.  All the reviews for the book are spot on. It rings of authenticity, something that it is usually difficult for a writer do but when you finish this book you have a feeling about this man and his experiences with Nine Section that, at least for me, I never felt before and I have read many military history books.  Nine Section is 10 men, like an American army squad led my a non-commissioned officer who is more of of the men rather than an officer.  There is no big picture here, just what faced this one small group of men in a very difficult time and place.Fraser's description of the 50th anniversary of VJ Day and his reluctant participation was very moving.His commentary on the "spirtual hypochondria" of the modern world was absolutely accurate. (pg. 89-90)  I loved his comment on intrusive modern television journalists when he said, "I can regret, though, that there were no modern television "journalists" transported back in time to ask Grandarse (a Nine Section soldier): "How did you FEEL when you saw Corporal Little shot dead?"  I would have like to have heard his reply."
