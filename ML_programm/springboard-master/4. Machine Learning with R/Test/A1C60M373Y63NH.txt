Ok, I'm a true Gregory fan. I always have been since "Wideacre" but I mean...come on!Her other books were exciting and made me want to keep reading! This one...it fell very, very short. I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. Yes, reading about how all the slaves were treated was heart-wrenching, but I get it. I would like to have some sort of plot to go along with that.When I did get a plot, it was a slow moving and dull one. I knew what was going to happen before it did and that just made it even more boring. Gregory used to have such flare! What happened here?
