"Nodding his head in approval of his logic, Mr. Justice Wargrave allowed his head to nod...""She screamed and screamed--screams of the utmost terror--wild, desperate cries for help."I first read "And Then There Were None" when I was nine and ordered it from the Scholastic Book Club. (It had been retitled "Ten Little Indians" as a promo for the movie of the same name starring Hugh O'Brian and Stanley Holloway, based on "And Then There Were None.") I did not yet realize that being a great genre writer didn't necessarily mean you were a great writer, and I also didn't know about editors and how even they can sometimes be asleep at the wheel. But, in any case, those two sentences--which even to my fourth-grade eyes seemed awfully inept--were what stayed with me from the book, more than anything else. "And Then There Were None" is widely considered to be Agatha Christie's masterpiece, the sheer ingeniousness of the plot mixing with an aura of impending doom to make an overwhelming reading experience. I guess that's true, and maybe I'm just too picky, but I keep thinking how much better the book would have been if written by, say, Raymond Chandler, or someone else who knew how to write a decent sentence. This is the main reason why I prefer film adaptations of Dame Agatha's books to the books themselves. Give me Albert Finney, David Suchet or Peter Ustinov as Poirot any day!
