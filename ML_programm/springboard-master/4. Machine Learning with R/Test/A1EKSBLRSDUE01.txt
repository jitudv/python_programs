I wanted to voice my opinion on this, but I don't wish to bore anyone with a long, drawn-out dialogue on a subject that many others have already given credit to.  Therefore, I shall merely point out that novels that have a longevity beyond a single generation as a respected and prolific work are simply in a league of their own.  This work rises to the top of that small selection, and is the standard by which ALL writing is set.
