I've had the benefit of reading the first five books in this series over the last year or so.  I can't believe haw hard it would be to keep up with the story if you had been at it over the last decade and a half!Splitting the story in half for books four and five has been interesting, but I would have much preferred the story kept in chronological order.  I spent way to much time worrying about what was going on with the lost characters in book four, and too much effort trying to tie the timeline together in book five.  It will be comforting to have everyone back together again for book six, that is if any characters actually survive that long?This is a grand story, and an engrossing story to follow.  I hope Mr Martin doesn't keep us waiting too long for the conclusion!
