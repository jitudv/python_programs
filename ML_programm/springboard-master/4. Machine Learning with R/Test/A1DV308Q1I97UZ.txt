Everybody knows something about Henry VIII.  It's the favorite story of lust, excess and irony for more than 400 years.  But is it worth reading a 661 page book to learn a little more?  If what you want to know is history, The Other Boleynn Girl is a little short.  (You can learn a lot more on Wikiipedia.)  For insight into the human condition, you'll fare better.  Phillippa Gregory has a special gift in that regard.  But you're probably reading the book now because the movie just came out and you want to read it before you go to the theatre.I chose the book as research for my Film and Literature class hoping that I could find some new material.  I enjoyed it for many of the same reasons other reviewers have mentioned (even the negative comments) but after viewing the film, I was a little disappointed.  Most films made from literary sources are by nature abbreviated, but the film of The Other Boleynn Girl is literally a  shorthand version of the book.  I don't know how you could follow it if you didn't have some knowledge of the events before you entered the theatre.  It wouldn't hurt to have a computer handy to review the real histories of the characters and events.  You'll find lots of discrepancies but you'll be able to lord them over your friends at coffee after the movie.While the book is colorfully detailed about locations, clothes and personalities, the film is dark, the personalities shallow (except for the sisters), and the men all seemed to look alike. But two of my favorite actresses, Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson, were splendid in the scaled-down script they were given.You don't have to see the film, but you'll find it irresistible after you finish the book--if only to show off your knowledge.
