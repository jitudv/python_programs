Read all others in hard copy but this one I used the cloud to download it. The only problem with reading in on a tablet is that when I want to see a map of where the people in the book are I can't easily access it (or haven't figured out how to yet). Same with the end of the book where they give all the houses and who belongs to each. Cannot access this either. Had to go to Amazon today and had to &#34;Look Inside&#34; at the first few pages of the book so I knew what was where. Normally having to flip to the beginning or end of a book is not a problem but with this story not being able to flip back and forth is an issue.
