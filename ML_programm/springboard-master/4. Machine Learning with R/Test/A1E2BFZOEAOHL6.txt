Really interesting read if you like early England and the courts of the kings and queens. Well written and gave insight into how it could have felt to be a girl born during that time and in their particular cast. Written from the perspective of the Anne's sister and gave one a picture of the King, Henry the VIII and just how ruthless he really was. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC2MDG/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img
