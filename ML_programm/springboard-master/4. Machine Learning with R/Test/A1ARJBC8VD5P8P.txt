To ride Hell's Chasm is simply spellbinding. The plot is there and definitely the novelty, the magic and the excitement. The myriad characters of  humans, sorcerers, demons and of course the horses and the world they live in are brilliantly conceived. My salute to Wurts for her vivid imagination. However for me, it is the protagonist, the warrior Mykkael who truly shines. I find myself engrossed with his purpose, his sorrows, his die-hard loyalty, his dignity, his courage and finally his emotional triumph.My only regret is that this splendid fantasy has not been crafted into a trilogy. The references to Mykkael's past life definitely justify this approach. The first of the trilogy could have been about Mykkael's birth, youth, ostracism from his tribe, the second concerning his life as a mercenary tormented by the horror of fighting sorcery culminating to his loss and finally the third, the story &quot;To ride Hell's Chasm&quot; itself. However with the ending Wurts has weaved I guess I have to say goodbye to Mykkael. I will definitely miss this amazingly intriguing and enigmatic character and the world he lives in. Still the conclusion is satisfying as Mykkael finally gets his just rewards. Truly an amazing read.
