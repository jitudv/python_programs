The one-star reviews are accurate and I agree with their criticism.However, surely we know that Amy Tan is not writing anthropological, or sociological material for academic research nor for intellectual inquiry. She's writing novels to entertain and to MAKE MONEY. Her genre is no more, or less worthy than espionage thrillers, medical thrillers, forensic thrillers,... or any other type of novel. She has a formula that works so it makes sense to keep using it!Amy Tan's books are faithful renditions of the Asian propensity for tragedy, managing relationships, victim of global events, self-sacrifice,... She paints characters with the right gestures, accents, behaviors and beliefs.If you like cultural/social details, accurately described but in an entertaining way, do read Tony Hillerman's many books about modern Navajo culture.The Shape Shifter
