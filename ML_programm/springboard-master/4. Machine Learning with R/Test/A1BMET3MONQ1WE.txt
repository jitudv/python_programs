A bookgroup choice that I am not sure I would have picked up on my own. It was an interesting read although not a "you have to read this" book. I felt (and my bookgroup concurred) that the story started well but got a bit lost and wandering in the middle. It went off it what I felt was the wrong direction of all the directions it could have gone.It made an interesting discussion because of all the time periods and subject matter that was covered but this was also one of the faults of the book, as it kept wandering off the path of the most interesting part of the story.The author got bogged down at times at what a lot of us felt were unnecessarily detailed descriptions of the scenery.I would really give this a 3.5 but not quite a 4, as it was a worthwhile read but could have been a lot better.
