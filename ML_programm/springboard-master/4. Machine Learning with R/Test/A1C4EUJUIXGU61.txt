If you love The Lord of the Rings, this set is of the highest possible quality. No other publication of the story can come close to this one. In other words, if you just want to read the story and throw it away, buy a used &quot;regular&quot; copy. But if you treasure it and want to read it again, THIS IS THE ONE TO HAVE. I bought it sometime ago and it is a treasure on my shelf next to the Hobbit's similiar book (and to which every thing I said is just as true). Actually you MUST read the Hobbit BEFORE you see the movie if you truly want to understand it, because that is where it all starts, and the movie makes MUCH MORE SENSE if you've read it first, especially since they left almost the entire story out--so your're starting well into the TRUE STORY, and may have trouble making sense of some things that happen.
