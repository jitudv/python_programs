...you'll love this set of books. LotR is what introduced myself and many others into the wonderful and imaginative (and at times clich&eacute;d) world of fantasy. But this is where it all began.LotR is somewhat of a followup to the children's book, the Hobbit. It talks of what happens after Bilbo finds his ring and returns to Bag End. Without going into too much detail to avoid spoiling something, Bilbo entrusts the ring to his heir, Frodo, who has to set out and destroy it. Of course, the actual story is much more descriptive, with elegant speech, realistic and vivid backdrops as well as surprises around every corner.Whether you don't like fantasy, have never tried it, or, and especially, if you're a huge fan of the genre, read this book. I guarantee, it will give you a new perspective of how you see literature.
