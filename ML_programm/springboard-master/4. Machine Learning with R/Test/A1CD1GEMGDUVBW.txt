This is the story of a Chinese woman and her American daughter. The daughter has a hard time understanding her mother and feels that she is losing her grip on reality. She believes her mother is constantly confused and can no longer take care of herself. Then one day she comes across the true story of her mother's childhood and what she had to go through to make it to the United States. It is a tale of much suffering, but a great deal of inner strength. Through this story the mystery that is her mother is unraveled, and through this new understanding of her mother, she can begin to understand herself.This book was riveting from start to finish. It begins with a simple phrase, which drew me in and wouldn't let go: Things I Must Not Forget. I was touched by the story of hardship, but it was also a story of finding inner strength through adversity. This strong message held me throughout the story, and also after I finished. I felt I could relate to the characters on a personal level, something that I've found in all of the Amy Tan novels I've read. each character is very human and three dimensional; a blending of good and bad traits. I loved this book and highly recommend it for anyone.
