The boxed set is a wonderful way to pass on the fun to the next generation of readers.  I recently  bought the set for two nephews and a niece, and they all enjoy having a set of books that look &quot;professional.&quot;I don't really need to comment on the story, because many others have  already done so.  It goes without saying that these books are top of the  line novels that will provide days of reading pleasure for the young and  old (that's me) alike.
