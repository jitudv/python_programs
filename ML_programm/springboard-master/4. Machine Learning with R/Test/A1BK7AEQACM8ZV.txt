This book is very thought-provoking.  The ideas brought up challenge one's conception of life on Earth; our political, economic, and religious systems are under Clarke's microscope.It is also very well written, once again convincing me that Clarke is the best pure writer of the big three of his generation of sci-fi authors (Asimov and Heinlein, being the others).Unfortunately, the story itself seems not to progress very much.  There is no "conflict".  The story just seems to meander a bit and then the ends.  I really enjoyed this book because it had so many of the great features of a classic sci-fi novel, but the story-line needed a more.
