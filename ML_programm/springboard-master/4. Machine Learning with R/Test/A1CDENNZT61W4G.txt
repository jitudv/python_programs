Oh this book. I read this book all day today, between patients at work. I couldn't put it down. In some ways it was very repetitive, which frustrated me a bit. I think the book either quotes or restates 10% of The Bronze Horseman. It got to be a bit much for me. However, because of the tension, the heart-breaking suspense, I loved this book regardless. I loved reading it and I can't wait to read the next and final one in the series.
