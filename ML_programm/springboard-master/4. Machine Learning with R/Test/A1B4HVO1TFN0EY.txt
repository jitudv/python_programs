Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None is the story of ten strangers who are invited to Indian Island by the mysterious U.N. Owen. The mystery starts once the guests arrive and find that Mr.Owen himself is nowhere to be found. Although I usually don't read mysteries (I read this one for school.) I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes murder mysteries that leave the blood and gore out and focus mostly on the plot. The characters (all ten of them) were so realistic I couldn't help but hope that certain characters would be U.N. Owen's next victims. The only thing that I didn't like about this book is the fact I had already been able to guess who U.N. Owen was by the end of the book. I would recommend this book to anyone even if you have already seen the movie. ( The plot varies a little between the book and movie.)
