For a long while I have waited to read these books.  I very much enjoyed the Farseer trilogy that she wrote (I read it a few years ago) and just knew that this series would be just as good, so I guess I was waiting for the right moment of enjoyment.  I am not displeased of my choice.  I was wrong in one thought that I had, while this story is in the same world as the first trilogy, it is not exactly connected to the first. There are all new characters and magics.I found the idea of the Live Ship to be a very interesting thing to read about and Hobb did a wonderful job of creating understanding of this as the story went on.  Certainly a wonderful quality of creating characters (in general), which of course is why I so much enjoyed the first story.  To gain a different way to sail and interact with a ship and crew.  I was glad of the start to get a glimpse of the proper way this was to happen and then the breaking and how I could feel the pain and wrongness of the choices of those in the book.  Every time I thought I figured out the connections that would occur later on I was wrong (mostly), and glad of it.Each character is strong and every time their tale is being told I was in rapture of what they were dealing with as well as the emotion that they felt.A Pirate captain with only the wish to capture a Live Ship to become a king.  A girl that just wants HER live ship.  A boy with the mind of priest having to live as a sailer and later as worse. A mother losing grip on her home and children as well as the daughter that only wishes to be grown and important, but with the attitude of a spoiled brat.  The mystery of what is up the river and what the true importance of that is.  As well as the Live Ship that is wrecked and pulled from the water defaced (literally) and dealing with what actually does not seem so much like insanity.  That is only a few of them.Such a great story has started.. and I am excited about moving on into the next one.
