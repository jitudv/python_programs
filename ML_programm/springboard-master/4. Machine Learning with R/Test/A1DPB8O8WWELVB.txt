this is a great book for you.  I really don't like historical fiction.  I like history, and I like fiction but prefer them not to be intertwined other than the occasional historical reference within the context of a fiction work.  That said, I read this because it was a selection for my book club and did enjoy it.  Seems the author has done her research on this era and she weaves a believable tale.
