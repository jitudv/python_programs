Having read the very fine and riveting, "The Other Bolelyn Girl", I expected another good read.  Maybe not as great as the first one, but a solid one .  The opening chapter of "The Queens Fool" sparkled with promise, and I had a rush of satisfaction thinking I was in for another wonderful story.  Once past the first chapter, however, the entire writing style changed, and seemed to lose its strength and focus.  Too much repetition of language about Queen Mary, (blah, blah, blah and more blah, blah, blah), and I found myself skipping around the pages.  Not a good thing.  Phillippa Gregory is a good writer, but for some reason this story just wasn't up to the quality of her other books.  It just seemed to repeat itself endlessly.
