I have never missed a Jack Higgins novel. But the last couple of his books have been extremely monotonous reads. Same characters, same predictable conversations. I know I am not going to be reading his latest books more than once. But these books may still provide for exciting reading to those who are not used to his work. I hope he can come up with a better book next time around (and with different characters).
