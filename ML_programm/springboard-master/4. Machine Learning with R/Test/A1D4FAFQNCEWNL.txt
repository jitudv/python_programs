This is J.R.R. Tolkien at his best if you can look beyond the weakness of the edition. He creates worlds full of life, and song, and color like no other. His personae are lovingly detailed, with their own characteristics and habits, born out of medieval Nordic sagas that have proven so fruitful an inspiration for modern literatuThe Woman and The Ravenre.
