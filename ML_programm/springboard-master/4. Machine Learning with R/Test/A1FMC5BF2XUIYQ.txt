Originally published in 1964, "The Secret of Terror Castle" by Robert Arthur is the first installment in The Three Investigators books, a young adult mystery series reminiscent of The Hardy Boys. The trio is comprised of Bob Andrews, a bookish youth who works part-time at the local library and is in charge of records and research for the Three Investigators; Pete Crenshaw, an athletic type who serves as Second Investigator; and Jupiter Jones, the erudite First Investigator. Jupiter is a young teenage Sherlock Holmes who employs an extensive vocabulary and is able to deduce information from seemingly trivial facts, and he has fortuitously just won a contest permitting him the use of a chauffeured Rolls Royce for one month. Determined to establish the Three Investigators detective agency, he contacts Reginald Clarke, an English director who is seeking a haunted house to use in his next movie and who reluctantly agrees to allow the boys to aid his search.Their first investigation takes them to Terror Castle, home of the deceased horror-movie legend, Stephen Terrill. As they attempt to probe the formidable estate and its secrets, they may find more than they bargained for as they realize that something has been frightening people away for years, and with good reason! Their exploration leads them on an exciting adventure that becomes dangerous when they begin receiving warnings to stay away from Terror Castle and then encounter various mishaps. Someone or something doesn't want them to uncover whatever mysteries are lurking in the old building, and their skills and courage will be put to the test."The Secret of Terror Castle" is a fun and light mystery for teenagers and for anyone who enjoys detective fiction and a trip down memory lane to a somewhat simpler time in which the closest thing to a cell phone is a bulky car phone. The adventure is entertaining but relatively anodyne, and there are no cliffhangers, but it remains an amusing jaunt for a rainy afternoon.
