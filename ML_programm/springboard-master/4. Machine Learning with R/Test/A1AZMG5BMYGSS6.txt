The Bonesetter's Daughter chronicles the stories of three generations of Chinese women beginning with the Bonesetter's Daughter, her daughter LuLing, and finally LuLing's daughter, Ruth who lives in present-day America, all intricately woven within the back-drop of World War II and the invasion of China by the Japanese.  The book itself is divided into a "prologue" and three parts.  The prologue and the third part are written from the perspective of LuLing with the second and fourth parts written from Ruth's perspective.  The prologue is a short introduction (only 6 pages) which serves to introduce LuLing to the reader, to insert foreshadowing, and to set up the intrigue in their story:  who is the Bonesetter's Daughter and what role is she to have in forging the mother-daughter relationship between LuLing and Ruth?Part One of the story begins with the introduction of Ruth, who is a Chinese-American woman working as a ghost writer and cohabiting with a man and his two teenage daughters.  There is a related plot line examining Ruth's relationship with her partner, but for the most part Ruth's and LuLing's (the Mom's) tense and difficult relationship is described beginning with Ruth's childhood up to present day.  In essence, LuLing's history is shrouded in mystery and these two women simply do not know or understand each other. The chapter ends with Ruth discovering LuLing's diary written in calligraphed Chinese characters prompting her to find someone to translate the diary into English.Part Two transitions into what is presumably being translated.  That is, we are transported back in time to LuLing's and her family's history in "Immortal Heart", China circa early 1900's.  Tan does a marvellous job of detailing the geographical, cultural, political, and historical context in which LuLing was born.  In Part Two, all is revealed in detail concerning LuLing's lineage, childhood, and early adulthood leading to her arrival in the United States, post-World War II.At this point, in Part Three, the reader returns to Ruth's perspective in present day U.S.  As LuLing's story is uncovered by Ruth, she reaches new understandings concerning her mother and thus becomes enlightened about her relationship with her mother and with her partner.  I don't want to reveal too much of the plot here.This is the first Amy Tan book I read.  It was chosen as part of my Book Club and I was excited to read it as I've always been so curious about what the buzz was all about with Amy Tan.  Tan does some things really well.  The development of the characters is so incredibly well done.  Whether you like the characters or not (and they are each deeply flawed), you can still empathize with them because they are so rich in description.  Similarly, Tan does an excellent job of vividly describing the setting of the story so that you feel you are actually there experiencing the same things as the characters.  So, I do feel that the storytelling is very engaging.  But, by the same token, I did sometimes feel that some things dragged on to the extent that I was left wondering "What is the purpose of this paragraph?"  I found this to especially be the case with regards to the descriptions of food.  For example:"In the vegetable aisle, Ruth headed toward a bin of beautifully shaped turnips.  They were each the size of apples, symmetrical and scrubbed, with striations of purple.  Most people did not appreciate the aesthetics of turnips, Ruth thought as she chose five good ones, whereas she loved them, their crunchiness, the way they absorbed the flavor of whatever they were immersed in, gravy or pickling juice.  She loved cooperative vegetables.  And she loved turnips best when they were sliced into wedges and preserved in vinegar and chilies, sugar and salt." [ p. 38]Am I missing some critical symbolic meaning of the turnips!?  Where's the editor here?  Chop, chop!!  These types of passages just made this book feel looooong.Another thing that Tan did beautifully is thread the theme of voicelessness and written text throughout the narrative.  So, for example, each generation of these women experience "voicelessness" in very different ways, but both use and find their voice in identical ways, through written text.  In the case of Ruth, Part One begins with the following:"For the past eight years, always starting on August twelfth, Ruth Young lost her voice." [p. 9]As it turns out, Ruth is also a ghostwriter.  Writing proved to be a critical and important tool for each of the women in the book.  In fact, LuLing's family owned an ink-making and selling business - this is not mere coincidence but central to the book's plot.  But there is also the more symbolic reclaiming of voice which occurs as well.  Tan's writing in this respect is exceptional.So, the reason I'm only giving this book 3 stars is that, while the writing is beautiful and the narrative rich, I found the story itself to be underwhelming.  Further, I felt that the characters in the book were "stereotypical" to the extent that it made me uncomfortable in some parts.  But then, it was written by a woman whose parents were Chinese immigrants, so I guess she would know!  But, at the end of the day, the story was very slow to develop - I would call it a sleepy yarn of a story and I simply did not find it that memorable.
