George MacDonald Fraser's "Flashman: A Novel" is a funny ribald fictional account of a 19th century British officer and his adventures.  The book starts with Flashman joining the famed 11 Regiment of Light Dragoons in England.  Soon his adventures take him to Scotland (after a duel with a fellow officer), then to India, and finally to Afghanistan.Flashman is an anti-hero.  There is nothing redeeming about him - his entire life is focused on taking care of himself, usually with women and drinking.  He is completely and unabashedly a coward and ends up being a survivor (in real life there was only one) of the British retreat from Kabul and a hero of the siege of Jalalabad.  Despite his cowardice and lack of redeeming qualities, you can't help but laugh at him and his adventures and pull for his continued "success."
