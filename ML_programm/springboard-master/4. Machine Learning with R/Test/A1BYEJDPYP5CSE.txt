Any book that can explain away organized religion (I almost converted to the idea of Alpha the utterly indifferent), expalin away organized politics (not government), explain the missing nutrino problem (what appears to be actual now 15 years later is just as amazing, but far less satifying), explain zero point energy and create a world as wonderful as Tarna deserves to be called the best.  I do think this is my favorite Arthur C. Clarke book (and I rate it up there with Moving Mars by Greg Bear).You could do much worse than reading this book.
