i picked up this book cuz i was curious about the event of the end of the British Raj.  in countless other books, this subject came up over and over.  now i see why.  it is not only about the breakup of England's control over India, and the formation of Pakistan and India.  the interplay of events, personalities, religion, politics, the intense discrimination between Indians themselves, all had a part to play in the awful way things played out. it is very very easy to say religion caused everything that went wrong, or that England totally screwed up the separation when they knew better, but these authors make sure we see the big picture.  this book does not describe a morality play of conquerors vs. natives, or the good religion vs. the bad ones. the book really describes all too human motives and fallabilities that in this case, caused India's woes, but it could have happened wherever humans live and create societies that rub up against each other.
