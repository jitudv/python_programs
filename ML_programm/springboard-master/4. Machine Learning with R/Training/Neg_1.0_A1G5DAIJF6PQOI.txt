Only good point of this book , his writing skills are still sharp as ever.Now bad points, I dont pay money to read about nothing happening. Plot doesnt go anywhere.There is no character development or movement in the timeline.Coming to violence , he must really have a dark and dreary mind if he cannot write a single chapter of hope, of unsullied dreams. I am tired of reading about his endless sufferings that the good guys have to suffer. By trying to make his bad guys so bad he is making them look like fools. & he is forgotten about the main threat from behind the Wall. There is no appearance of them in the entire novel.I was compelled to write such a scathing review of him because he is a well-establised behaving like he can get away anything.One star is because of the beautiful writing.
