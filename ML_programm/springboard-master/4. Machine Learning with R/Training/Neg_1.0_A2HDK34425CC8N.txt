I've read hundreds of thrillers, and this one started out relatively slowly, I almost gave it up in the first hundred pages because it seemed like it was just plodding along, but the writing was good so I kept at it.The middle got really good, the writer was really rounding out the character and all the pots put on to simmer got boiling (the neighbor was a bit obvious, the reader never thinks he's wholly who he seems to be, the only question is who is he spying on Stephanie for, but it's a nice touch), he sets up a jim-dandy climax at the end inside the airplane...... then kicks you in the gut with an ending as credible as a Hamas press release.  You feel completely cheated, realizing that he's set you up for 400+ pages for a thin, limp little pro-Palestinian terrorist screed, he's sacrificed any credibility his character had (which was quite a lot, the scenes with Iain Boyd are wonderfully written) for the sake of jihadist PR, and you can quite understand why so many of his books, all published quite recently, seem to be out of print.  After being jerked around so badly and clumsily by the ending I'm certainly never going to read or buy anything else he writes.And it's not just his political viewpoint, if the positions were reversed it would still be the most fake, insulting, unreal ending outside of a North Korean propaganda film.  Shame, since once he got going this book was really well-written.  Lilies that fester, however -- had the main character been any less believably drawn you wouldn't feel so lied to at the end.
