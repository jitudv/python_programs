This was the first Inspector Alleyn mystery I ever read so it holds an extra special place in my heart.  Marvelous characters and a great mystery make this one of Marsh's best.  The character of Troy Alleyn, a respected portrait painter, starts off the tale never expecting to be plunged into intrigue.  She more than manages to hold her own until her husband is called in to solve the case.  Quirky players, a little twisted holiday spirit, and the standard Ngaio Marsh wit make this book stellar.  A must read and a great first book for Marsh newcomers.
