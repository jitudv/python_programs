Okay, you get a tiny bit of movement in this one, but most of that is accomplished by killing off characters gratuitously, particularly those who have behaved honorably. And that's it.  No wonder he writes so slowly! He's great at starting things off...and very bad at keeping them going. This book rehashes a lot of previous material, to the extent of copying whole paragraphs from Book 4. Frankly, I found myself frequently bored and finally frustrated. Having R.R. for middle initials is not enough to make one an author comparable to Tolkien.
