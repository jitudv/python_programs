Water for Elephants is a story about an old man's recollection of his days working for the circus, and the bizzare array of characters circus work attacts.  The setting transitions between the wild memories of working as a veterinarian for a travelling circus, set in the 1930s, and the protagonist's present life in a home for the elderly, lonely and unappreciated.  Themes of the book include romance, good vs evil, depression era desperation, and life in old age.The main character is a well studied near-graduate from an Ivy league school who loses everything after a catastrophe and feels he must run away and happens upon a circus train. He ends up working in very rough conditions to survive, and struggles with a love triangle that puts his life in peril.My personal affection for the book lies in the brutal conditions desperate people will endure, particularly for those who feel they have no place to go, as some of these characters do.  I'm also very fond of the contrast of how the elderly protagonist struggles with trivial tasks, like wanting to eat a crisp apple, while his younger self survived through such turbulent times.  Finally, the layout of the story, in which some details are revealed out of order through the time-transitions, enables the reader to piece certain details together before the main narrative gets to it feels like a device out of the movie Pulp Fiction (in a good way).This novel is written based off of actual and anecdotal incidents of circus life (as per the interview with the author contained in the back of the book).  The historical basis, however, is unnecessary to appreciate the vivid story but definitely made me appreciate the author's research to include tidbits of American history that might otherwise be lost.  I found this novel to be the most compelling book I have ever read and literally lost hours of sleep over it.
