The reason why virtually all of this man's novels are on the New York Time's bestseller list is because they are all politically correct to the extreme -- brilliant black psychologists and heroines , racist police and villains, heroic Black figures assasinated by racists.You can only go so far before you start to delude reality and make the book unbelievable and James Patterson certainly does that, particularly in this book.
