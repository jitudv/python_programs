What a tale! Ms Gregory is a wonderful historical storyteller and doesn't disappoint in this novel. &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; gives the story of Anne and Henry the VIII from the sister's perspective. This allows the reader to observe the sad story from the outside but with feeling and personal observations. The historical information alone will knock your socks off. Great, wonderful read for those that like substance in their romances.
