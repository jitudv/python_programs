When veterinary student Jacob Jankowsi's life is unexpectedly torn asunder, he escapes by hopping aboard a passing train. It turns out to be a circus train.  The story alternates between the few months Jacob spends with the Benzini Bros. circus during the Depression and the current day, in which Jacob is 90+ years old and an unhappy resident of a nursing home.  Although most of the story centers on the circus years, the author does an excellent job of showing the loss of companionship, the loss of independence, and the loss of dignity that accompany old age.  It's these passages that ultimately make this a sad book for me.  No matter how the circus portion of the story turns out, we know how unhappy Jacob is at the tail end of his life.Although Jacob falls in love with Marlena, the unhappily married star of the equestrian act, the love story wasn't the main focus of the story for me.  In fact, that aspect of the story didn't pick up steam until fairly late in the book.  It was more of a coming of age/adventure story.  The author did a wonderful job of researching Depression-era circus life and making the reader a part of it. And what a brutal life it was:  the horrors of poisonous bootleg liquor, prostitution, terrible treatment of both animals and staff members, lack of pay, and &#34;red lighting&#34; - throwing people off the moving train who had fallen out of favor or were simply no longer worth the expense.  If they were lucky, they were thrown off near a town.  If they were unlucky, they were thrown off a trestle.  But it's also a story of survival and caring among both the animals and the people.  It's a fascinating story and I highly recommend it, even though I found it to be a bit sad.
