I can't say it any better than some of the other reviewers already have said it. The author has lost his way, developed too many characters that we don't care about, and spent too many words saying nothing.I wish I had not spent the money and much more importantly the time on this book. This author is too busy writing cookbooks and blogging about football, he should turn the franchise over to someone else so they can at least finish the stories. We read books to escape not to be tortured.Also - the american tolkein? Really? The way these last 2 books have been, they really are just rated M or NC17 soap operas.SPOILER ALERT:Cliffhangers that simply do not get resolved (e.g. Brienne, how did she get out of being hung? - thought it would be resolved in this book? WRONG).Seige by Stannis, and then it's over with NO DETAILS. Wow. Big twist with the onion knight. He's dead, he's not dead - in the end who cares nothing happens. Just a huge waste of time.
