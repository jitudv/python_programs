To make my point I'll be as concise as possible in this review. 90% of this and Feast for Crows were not only boring, but pointless to plot. The other part of the problem in Feast, repeated here, is focus on characters that aren't interesting. And most importantly, Martin's insistence on the use of internal narrative over and over again - whether it be simple thoughts or dream sequences - is completely unnecessary. When it was Catelyn remembering playing with her sister and Littlefinger as kids I could take it, because those folks were interesting. But I don't need 200 pages to realize that Cersei hates everyone, and I don't need 200 pages of Dany contemplating, or Tyrion pissing.  I don't need to be reminded anymore that Davos has lost his fingers. If this book was going to be terrible couldn't it have been shorter?!  Maybe in more need of an editor than anything I've read this side of a Bill Simmons article.
