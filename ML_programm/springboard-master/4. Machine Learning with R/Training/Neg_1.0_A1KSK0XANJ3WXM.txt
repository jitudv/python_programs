In this book, Martin introduces several more variously important characters, has several of the characters we know turn into people we don't recognize, most notably Tyrion. He produces plot complication after plot complication.Every thread ends with a cliff-hanger. It is as if Martin wants this series to outlive him, not figuratively as having its reputation live on but literally. He wants to die leaving his readers wanting more.Fine with me but I'm done with it.
