I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun book that keeps the reader coming back for more. It is an absolute roller coaster of human emotion that develops characters that are identifiable. Gruen's "warts and all" approach to character development makes the story fell real and compelling. Excellent, well written book! A must read!
