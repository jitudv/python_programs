I read many of the negative reviews and I find that I can only agree with some who felt that a lot of the chapters dealing with Dany's court problems were too long and quite tedious.  The other great compliant I read was about the story not being moved forward.  I disagree in that Martin has set out to create a world populated with characters you can believe in. In real life as you grow from youth into adulthood and then old age each of us encounters a myriad of characters.  Some play a major role in our lives; most do not.  But all of them combine to contribute to the richness of our experience.  I felt Martin was emulating life to a great degree in this fashion and what I took away from this read was the enjoyment of being given a further tour of a world that had captured my attention from the first volume of this saga.  If Martin was any less adept at painting scenes with words this book would have been horrendously boring.  As it is he still has the talent to whisk a reader away and show them the marvels of a world capable of harboring dragons.  I just wish he was able to crank out the books faster but if the time waiting is needed in order to achieve this level of word-smithing  I can be patient.
