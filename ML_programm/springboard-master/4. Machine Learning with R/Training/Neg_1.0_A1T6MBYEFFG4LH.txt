I do not want paperback books cluttering my bookshelves.  If you know of somebody that does, by all means have at it.  The book that I am currently reading, the hardcover of this, is well worth the time of any RH fan.  There is no need to read the Liveship Traders series to be able to enjoy this, but LSTs searies will addd additional flavor to this series.
