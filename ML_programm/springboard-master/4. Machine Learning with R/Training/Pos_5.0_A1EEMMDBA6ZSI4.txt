'Red Mars' is one of the best science fiction books I have ever read.As you probably guessed by the cover and name, this book is about a group of astronauts and scientists who colonize mars. Kim Stanley Robinson talks about the selection process of the astronauts, he delves into the hardware that took these astronauts to Mars. He talks about nearly every aspect of life on mars (from the physiological and sociological ramifications, to political and physical problems that could arise in such as situation). Robinson not only makes it all plausible, he does it in a way that the story is not just facts and statistics: this is a story of love, politics, engineering, religion, and psychology.Many here have said that this book isn't for people on the conservative right; I disagree. BOTH liberals and conservatives could learn a thing or two from this book. I have read The Communist Manifesto, the constitution, many libertarian works....and 'Red Mars' was THE first book I've read that really challenged my political beliefs. Since reading this series I have thought things over more carefully. I am more understanding of nature (and human nature). I am more open minded towards politics.If you are even remotely interested in this book I implore you to get it. You won't be disappointed.
