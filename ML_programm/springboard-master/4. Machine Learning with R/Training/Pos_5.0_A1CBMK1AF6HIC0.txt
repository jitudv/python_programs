A story of circus life was not especially enticing, but my book club was reading this novel. I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the narrative. There is a little bit of something for everyone. Disappointment, joy, romance, a view of youth and of old age. Take a flyer and buy this book if you want a well written escape! Thanks!
