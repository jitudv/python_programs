I remember when Cecil B. Demille directed a behemoth circus film called "The Greatest Show On Earth" in the early 50's.  It had such spectacle, and what a star-studded cast headed by the great Jimmy Stewart, Cornel Wilde, Betty Hutton...it was, just, well, awful.  Yes, AWFUL.  And ya know, Hollywood decided to give this giant piece of piffle the year's BEST PICTURE Oscar.  I mean, it really makes you wonder why people (uh, powerful people, that is), go to the trouble of praising something that's not worth the price of admission.  Could it be....to make the film more profitable???  Could it be....money, money, and hopefully more money????  To gush and fawn over something so abysmal, luring the public into conforming to the propogandic publicity, that it finally becomes a pseudo-masterpiece, not to be missed?Know what I mean?Because if you don't, then borrow (DON"T BUY!!), Sara Gruen's Best-selling monkey-poop called "Water For Elephants".  This is a book that may give the beginning writer hope and much needed optimism.  Repeat after me...."If Sara Gruen can be a published writer, then I can be a published writer".  It's so easy you don't even have to develope characters to any great extent, as long as you have a skeletal outline of your story, just scribble it down and then decorate with some tacky sex so it doesn't fall into the children's market.  Make sure the story is narrated too, but make sure it's just about as pretentious a narration as you can dream up.  Then populate the text with various freaky deaky characters and situations....like animal torture and alcoholism.  Then let the 'big boys' market it for you and wait for the film, that will hopefully have an all-female cast.  I mean, who cares?
