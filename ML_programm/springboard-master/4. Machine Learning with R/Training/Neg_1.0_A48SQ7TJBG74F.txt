Books 1, 2, 3...works of genius. Amazing! Spellbinding! Couldn't shut up about them. Book 4? Hmmm. Maybe it's a fluke. Maybe the author has been ill. But here now we have Book 5 and the realization that it's no fluke. Martin has lost his way.Like every other reader, I want the original characters and families to come back! I want them to evolve, grow up, turn evil, go mad, save the world, destroy the world...anything! I could give two figs about the hundreds of new, irrelevant, window-dressing characters that were introduced in 4 and 5: One-Eyed This, One-Armed That, the Giant, the Forked Beard, Green Grace, Blue Grace, Kindly Man. It's exhausting. If there's a prize for 'Most Useless Characters in a Single Novel', Martin wins.The power house families have crumbled but rather than rebuild them (Lady Catelyn appears only briefly in Book 4 despite her character's fantastic potential for vengeance and villainry!!) Martin has thrown us bones like Ramsay and Daario, hoping that we will keep gnawing.Seriously, I love George Martin's writing and he tells a wonderful story but I'm not sure I can endure a Number 6. Maybe we're all better off watching where HBO takes the story.
