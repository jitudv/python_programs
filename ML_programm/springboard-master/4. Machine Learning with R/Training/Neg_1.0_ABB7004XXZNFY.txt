I read constantly and I agree with other reviewers about the excessive and un-necessary violence in this book.  There are less than 5 books in my entire life I did not finish but I finally threw this book out - it was not fair to inflict it on my local library.  The time period is definitely violent but it seemed that whenever the author did not know what to do she threw in a rape scene.  I will never purchase another book by this author.
