Books 1-3 were engrossing and broke so many accepted standards for fiction, in a good way. Book 4 was acceptable, but overly long for the actual plot(s) progression. Book 5 barely moves any plot forward and makes me wonder if GRRM has totally given up on the series as a whole. It seems more like he is simply writing to fulfill some publisher's obligation. Mark Twain once wrote a long letter and apologized that he didn't have time to write a short letter. That's how this book feels: GRRM didn't have time to write a a good sequel and ended up just rambling all over the place, including every thought he ever had about the story line. And to think I waited five years for this! I feel totally betrayed by the author.
