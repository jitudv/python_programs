I cannot understand how 99 people can give this book 4 or 5 stars???  I couldn't even get past the first chapter as this was utterly UNBELIEVABLE even for a fantasy book.We have the 'reclusive genius', Lorenzo Marcus, making a rare speaking engagement at a college.  Marcus and his sidekick, Matt(who aren't who they appear to be, but more on that later.) set their sites on Kim Ford who they need for some 'mission'.  They, also, just happen to need four other people for their team and VOILA! Kim just happens to be accompanied by four other people.  How convenient.After the speaking engagement, Kim and her cronies wisk Mr Marcus and Matt away from the throng of admirers to go back to Mr Marcus's hotel.  But wait!  They are being followed and Paul (one of the five) is suspicious.  I guess he never gave it a thought that they just might be followed by one of Mr Marcus's admirers from the college?At the hotel, Paul calls them out and says, You aren't Lorenzo Marcus, are you?'  To which Mr Marcus confesses that his real name is Loren, but his friends call him 'Silvercloak', Matt was a King of the Dwarves and they come from a place called Paras Derval,in another world, where Ailell reigns.  Yeah, right??  I CERTAINLY would believe this guy that I have never met!!!DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS TRIPE!!!
