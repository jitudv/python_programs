Pearce begins his book pompously: "I am convinced that [this book] penetrates to the very core of its subject."  Yet, rather than provide insight into Wilde as Pearce claims, the book is only the Reader's Digest version of Ellmann's biography.  If you are short on time and want an overview of Wilde's life and work, you could do worse.  Just don't expect perceptive analysis.
