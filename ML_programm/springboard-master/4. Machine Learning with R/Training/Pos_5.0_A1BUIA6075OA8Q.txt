I avoided reading this book for a long time because I feared it was over rated- I was wrong.  Well worth the read. Good story, easily connected to the characters - loved every minute of it.For those who compared this book to HBOs series Carnival - very very wrong.... general story, the characters, theme - nothing the same. I was an avid watcher of the 'Carnival', the whole black magic thing- loved it. 'Water for Elephants' has none of that.  Comparing the two stories would be like comparing movies 'The Hangover' and the HBO series 'Empire Boardwalk' and the common trait is they both have gambling and take place in a gambling city (not event he same city).  'Carnival' and 'Water for Elephants' only common thread is that take place in the same time in history and based on traveling entertainers (not even the same type of traveling groups).My big regret is not finishing the book before they announced the movie and who was playing the characters - but that's not the books fault.
