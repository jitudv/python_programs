Being a Christian in today's society is  often a scary thing.  People love to bad-mouth our faith in something invisible.  This book gives us the tools to strengthen our own selves before we get brave enough to talk to others, to offer them hospitality and then to help them know God themselves.  It's a 'read more than once' book.
