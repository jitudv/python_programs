You are not William Faulkner.  You're not even Cormac McCarthy. You're a fine writer of soap opera scripts, which is perhaps why you have NO idea how to wrap this up and end it effectively.  Like Stephen King you started with some fine creativity, and when you became famous you began to think you were smarter than your editor.  You are wrong. Get some help.  You are just irritating most of your readers at this point.
