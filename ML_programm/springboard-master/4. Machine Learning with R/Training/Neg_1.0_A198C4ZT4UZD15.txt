...that 155 people rated this as 5 star. I agree with every 1 and 2 star review: BORRRR-iiing. I have been reading for 50 years and only never finished 1 book. Now, 2. I hate this author's style of writing: pages of technobabble with scientific formulas that neither make sense to the lay reader, nor serve a purpose, followed by such minute details of irrelevant,stupid things like the page long description of the contents of a tool box. Then, there is the overuse and abuse of the word "and". The author must never have heard of the use of commas. All of the endless descriptions of the Martian surface being flat and dusty with the scattered rocks really helps my insomnia though. I only made it to Chapter 11, so I guess I never got far enough for all the political hoorah other reviewers referenced. I just didn't get it. I was hoping for a great story about colonizing a new world. What I got was the second worst book I have ever tried to read. I'm glad I didn't pay for this.
