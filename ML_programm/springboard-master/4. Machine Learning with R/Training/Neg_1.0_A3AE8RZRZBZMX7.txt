I was sure I would love this book after reading the other reviews and the fact that I love historical English fiction, but this book is truly awful.  The premise is wonderful and the book starts off great, but it soon becomes repetitive and disjointed.  Also, I volunteer for a domestic abuse support center, and the scenes of a young woman allowing herself to be physically abused over and over were very disturbing.  I wish the book had lived up to my expectations.
