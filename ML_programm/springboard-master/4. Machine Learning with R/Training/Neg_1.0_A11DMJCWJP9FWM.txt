Maybe it gets to the exciting part somewhere, but all I've seen so far is melodrama and weird situations - like when the girl who the main character picks up  meets two strangers that are man and wife doctors, she allows the wife to give her a physical exposing that she was sexually brutalized and on drugs!Yeah, sure! And then this dock blabs it all to her new boyfriend, then the main character after sleeping with her for several days, only after the doc's report, notices the welt scars on her back!  Umm, I don't think so.And all this while, the main character is bawling about his wife who passed away 6 months prior, and the only action we get from him is him repairing the propellers on the doctors' boat!I am glad amazon has a lenient return policy. Four days of on and off reading and still no action gets this thing returned!
