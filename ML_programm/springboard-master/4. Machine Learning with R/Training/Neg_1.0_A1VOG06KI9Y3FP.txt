I first read &#34;The Demonologist&#34; fron Pyper and LOVED IT!!  So I bought &#34;The Guardians&#34; and &#34;Lost Girls&#34; with high expectations.  I first read &#34;The Guardians&#34; and really enjoyed that as well.  So I had high expectation for &#34;Lost Girls&#34;.  I struggled to finish the book.  Just a let down after reading Pyper's other two books.  The main character's personality was a turn off.  I didn't like the flow of the story.  I just found the storyline slow.  I might have had a different opinion had I read this book BEFORE the other two.  I just expected more.
