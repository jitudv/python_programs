CLANCY'S BEST BY FAR. THIS WAS GREAT. EXECUTIVE ORDERS PICKS UP WHERE DEBT OF HONOR LEAVES OFF. THE STROY LINE IS EXCELLENT, THE PLOTS DETAILED, MY ONLY CRITICISM WAS THAT THE BOOK SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE SHORTER. YOU GET THE FEELING THAT RYAN'S DECISIONS AND FRUSTRATIONS WITH GOVERNMENT ARE NOT JUST TOM CLANCY'S, BUT MINE, YOURS AND MOST EVERYONE'S. READ IT, BUT READ DEBT OF HONOR FIRST.
