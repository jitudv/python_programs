Clearly I was unhappy with this book since I'm only giving it 1 star, so let me start with the one thing good I can say about this.  The author does very good prose and character development.  The problem with this book is essentially one of focus.  For example, the first remotely exciting thing to happen is an assassination.  However, rather than actually writing about the assassination one chapter ends with "John Doe" giving a rousing political speech and the next chapter begins with "In the two weeks since "John Doe's" assassination . . .  Similarly at one point a war breaks out but the actual war is barely written about- instead we are told of the exploits of someone running around fixing what she can while the war takes place elsewhere.This book begins with the first 100 permanent Mars settlers on a ship on their way to Mars about 30 years in the future- which is why it is science fiction.  However, we are then told in excruciating detail about the political debates between crew and how junior high dating practices are common place on board.  I toughed it out through this whole book in the hope it would get better but it didn't and it commits one of the major sins of the genre:  Rather then setting out to write a good book the author sets out to write a trilogy and so this book ends a cliff hanger- although cliff hanger is relative term.  This book avoids anything resembling action or intrigue so here "cliff hanger" means just when I could believe the story was getting to an interesting part it ends.So, in short, this book avoids action, intrigue and adventure in favor of fictional politics, including legal debates.  (If you want to learn more about the legal status of antartica and the author thinks it will relate to Mars then you should read this book.)  I wish I would have been warned away so I wouldn't have wasted my time.  As it is I certainly will not be reading the next two books in this series.
