I feel really bad saying this, because the poor woman was 81 and had Alzheimer's when she wrote it, but this book is horrible. No plot development, no mystery, tedious and predictable. I didn't read any of the reviews before I bought it because I was afraid of spoilers, and because as a die hard fan I had trust in Christie's work. But I had no idea this was her final book, or that her mind was so far gone by the time she wrote it. I feel bad for her. She is truly a classic, and one of my favorite writers of all time. But I really wish I had skipped this one, and I recommend you do too.
