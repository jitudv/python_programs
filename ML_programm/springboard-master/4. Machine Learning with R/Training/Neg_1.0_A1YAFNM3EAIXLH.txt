I was taken over by book 1, had to have books 2 and 3, and even enjoyed AFFC. I couldn't wait for ADWD and bought the hardback right away;  but I didn't even finish it. I went to Wikipedia for the last 100 pages of the plot, or what is supposed to be a plot.  There was a huge increase in distasteful language  and descriptions in this volume. I guess this was to make Tyrion and some others more quirky & interesting. The whole Dragon Queen plot became totally Byzantine. I began to skim those portions. Jon's voice on the Wall became the same thing over and over. In fact, the whole book became the same thing over and over. What a waste of money. Before I started ADWD I was concerned about waiting 5 years for the next volume. Now...I could care less when it comes out! What happened?
