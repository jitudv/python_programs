Clancy should stick with the techno stuff.  His attempt to show the more human side of his characters flops.  Kelly, and every other character, is one-dimensional.  It is simply too trite that a man could fall instantly in love with a hitchhiker, without our having any hint of what he really sees in her, then spend the rest of the book obsessed with avenging her death.  Not that the guys didn't deserve it, mind you.  He does play with the gray areas of justifiable actions outside the law, kind of a human super-hero vigilante for whom police are probably grateful behind closed doors.  But this book has the literary depth of your average Sergeant Fury comic book.
