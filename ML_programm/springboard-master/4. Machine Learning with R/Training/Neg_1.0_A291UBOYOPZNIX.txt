It took me approximately 8 hours over the course of a week to read this garbage, and in retrospect I can certainly  think of things I would rather have been doing for that 8 hours, like, say, setting my hair on fire or arm-wrestling a 400 lb orangutang.  I reckon those activities would have been more fun and fulfilling.This is a truly bad novel.  Truly bad.  The writing is amateurish, the dramatic tension poorly developed, the dialogue awful and the character development is shallow and one-dimensional.  I could not get over how stilted and poor the writing was.  Our newly orphaned hero, Jacob Jankowski, dropped out of Cornell before his final vet exam, jumped a train containing the Benzini Bros travelling circus, got taken on as the circus vet, instantly fell hopelessly in love with one of the married showgirls despite spending barely any time alone with her, took on a cookie-cutter baddie to boot (boo, hiss!) and survived to live happily ever after to a ripe old age.  So there's the plot outline, which initially showed some promise.  Pity Ms Gruen did very little with it that didn't come across as a below par submission to a Creative Writing 101 Workshop.  Probably one of the worst books I've read this decade.  Under no circumstances read this poor excuse for a novel.  The fact that so many reviewers have given it 5-stars is a mystery on par with the Bermuda Triangle. Is it collective hysteria? I just don't get it.
