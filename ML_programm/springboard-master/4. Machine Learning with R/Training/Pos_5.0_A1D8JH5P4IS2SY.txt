I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I felt like I was right there with the characters as I read.  Couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  There were many twists and turns to the story that I didn't expect, and the ending was a suprise!  Thought I had it figured out, but not so.  Don't hesitate to pick up this one.
