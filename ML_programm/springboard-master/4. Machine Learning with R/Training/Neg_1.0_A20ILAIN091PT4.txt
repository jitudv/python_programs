This book is sort of a sequel to "The People of the Wind." It takes place many years after the first book and doesn't involve any of the same characters. It is a sequel only in that it takes place in the same universe and explores the same alien races.Unfortunately, the dialogue in this book is so poorly written as to make the book unreadable. In fact, I couldn't finish it. I tried but I just had to give up. I'm not sure what effect Anderson was trying to achieve but it didn't work.This is one for the trash bin.
