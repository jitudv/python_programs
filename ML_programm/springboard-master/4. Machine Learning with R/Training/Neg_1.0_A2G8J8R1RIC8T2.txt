I have been reading through this book and while it says some true things, it seems very judgmental, especially in the section about games people play.  I also thought it was meant to be written by a Christian, but in the section on Rationalization, it says "Choosing evil as evil is also a psychological impossibility, because the will can only choose the good".  I believe that is entirely untrue.
