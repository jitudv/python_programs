Having read two Hemmingway novels, I was not impressed.  Frankly, I was surprised that I did not enjoy them.  After growing up and hearing about the great Hemmingway, the man's man, I found his characters weak and whinny.  Ready to give up, I gave him one more try and I am glad he did. This is a magnificent novel.Set in the Spanish Civil War during the 1930s it tells the story of Robert Jordan, an American volunteer fighting against Franco and his fascist allies. This is first-rate story telling, it grabs the reader from the offset and pulls him into the story.  Unlike other Hemmingway novels (i.e., The Son Also Rises), these are heroic characters that we deeply care about.The imagery is magnificent.  I can still see in my minds eye, the retreating Republicans, the panicked soldiers, the horses out of control and the cartridge casings spilled in the road way.  If you are unfamiliar with Hemmingway, read this book first.  All the others will pale in comparison.
