My mother read this book a long time ago and recommended it to me but I never read it. I just recentlyu read in (June 2006) and glad I finally did. This book short essays on the different aspects of life. These are teachings and they are meant to inspire and advise. They are written in such a way so that the words are not rammed down your throat.
