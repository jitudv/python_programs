**Spoiler Alert**It is one thing to intermittently kill off a protagonist to keep the narrative, and by extension the reader, honest; It is quite another to systematically kill off every sympathetic character in the series to the point the reader honestly no longer cares what happens. The latter is where I find myself at this point, there is exactly one character left that I am invested in, and it is a peripheral character. Every other character I have become invested in over the years is dead. I suppose I could contrive empathy for another character, but why bother? It has already exceeded "fool me twice shame on me" and I'm done giving Martin the benefit of the doubt.There is simply no suitable conclusion to Jon's story at this point. Either he really is dead and his entire arc was a superfluous waste of time, or he is revived by some miracle resurrection which by now has become a cliche of the series. Furthermore, the nascent ubiquity of such miracle resurrections has destroyed the atmosphere of the series by embracing the very fantasy tropes Martin once openly flouted.There was a time when a pivotal character dying added to the suspense of the series by letting you know no character was safe. By this point, however, the same trick has been pulled so many times as to make the reader numb to any empathy for any character. Thus does the series become an exercise in nihilism without relevance, context, or discourse.
