I thought this was an interesting read until the author decided to label the villian of the piece as a paranoid schizophrenic.  August was cruel, sadistic and had violent mood swings.  None of these are symptoms of schizophrenia.  He did not hear voices, have complicated delusions, or an inability to keep touch with reality.  Unlike most unmedicated schizophenics, August had no trouble  thinking rationally or logically, on the contrary, he was in charge of a large section of the circus and exhibited fine organizational skills!The writer could simply have portrayed her character, August, as a jealous, violent man but instead she chose to advance the false stigma that people with schizophrenia are horribly cruel and violent or that they have a "split" personality. If only Gruen had researched psychiatry as well as she had the circus.I work with people who suffer from this disease.  While, without medication the patients delusions might possibly, rarely, lead them to do something violent, it's usually in relationship to fear associated with a delusion -- thinking a person is really an alien from outerspace, for example.  Never the sort of cold-blooded violence August engaged in.  August always knew exactly who or what he was hurting.When medicated, people with schizophrenia are actually less likely to commit violent acts than the general population.It's truly a shame when a popular book spreads stigma in this manner, the negative ripple effects go on and on.
