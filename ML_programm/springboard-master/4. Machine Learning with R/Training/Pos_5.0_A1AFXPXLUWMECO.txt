Without Remorse is by far my favorite Tom Clancy novel. John Kelly, also known in later novels as "John Clark," is a former Navy SEAL who does a good deed for a drifter, Pam, who turns out to be a runaway sex slave/prostitute; and he ends up falling in love with her. He helps her beat her drug addiction and learn to respect herself. They make a special life together.When Pam makes up her mind to go to the police with the information she has on the men who kidnapped and enslaved her, she does so in order to help the other girls still in captivity. Unfortunately, she is seen and recognized by her former captors before she can talk to the police.They shoot John and recapture Pam.When John recovers in the hospital and discovers that the woman he fell in love with has been brutally raped, tortured, and murdered--her body even being displayed in public as a warning; he sets off on a quest for justice and revenge. The methods he uses to exact his revenge are imaginative and well described.I've already said that this is my favorite Clancy novel. It is also my favorite revenge story. I've read it numerous times, and I'm sure I will read it several times more. This is a good place to start if you haven't read anything by Clancy before.
