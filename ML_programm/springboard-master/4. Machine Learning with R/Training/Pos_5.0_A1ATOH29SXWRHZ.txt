How had I never heard of these before? They&#8217;re pure fun.  Harry Flashman is a fictional British military hero from the 19th century whose memoirs (The Flashman Papers) are discovered decades later. In them, Flashman writes of his adventuring in the Afghan military campaign, going toe-to-toe with Otto Von Bismarck, and rubbing elbows/seducing/offending other historical figures. Flashman is the worst kind of lead: misogynist, a coward, racist, womanizing, opportunistic, selfish, clever, and lucky. Each of the Flashman Papers follows roughly the same story arc: Flashman, whose life is privileged and character irredeemable, finds himself in progressively worse and worse circumstances&#8212;partially of his own creation, partially of bad luck&#8212;but always emerges the hero of the story. Every book is like watching in slow motion as a friend drives your car drunk, totals it into preschool, then walks away without a scratch. The books work somewhat because of that simple formula, but moreso because they are so, so well executed. They&#8217;re funny, rife with dry English humor and absurd characters. They&#8217;re also easy page turners, so good for travel or pool reading.
