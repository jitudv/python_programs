This spy adventure starts out promisingly with an airport incident that can happen to anyone.  However, it quickly degenerates into plotlessness, lack of direction, and a boring lack of suspense.  The characters are so grotesque and unrealistic, that Christie loses one of her most formidable writing weapons: the ease with which her readers (normally) connect to the characters.  I could not connect, and after the first few chapters, could care less what happened to anyone.Christie uses this novel as a platform to present her age-old world view of a secret society that is plotting for world domination.  In it you see a lot of resentment towards the young, betraying the total incomprehension this octogenarian had for the generation of the 60s and 70s.  She mixes up student protests with leftist tendencies, "violence for the sake of violence", and neo-Nazi currents, all together.  Add to that the rambling, incoherent, conversation style of most characters, and you get a befuddled mess.What makes her other novels so great is her (usually) deep understanding of human nature.  Regrettably, she doesn't show this understanding here.  The young are mere hypnotist fodder, to be brainwashed by whoever is capable of doing so.Even worse than Elephants Can Remember, the only reason to read this is to say that you're read all of Christie's books.  I just quit halfway.
