Okay, so I'm not a Cussler fan and read the book on a dare.  This book is laughable.  The writing is inept, the plot facile.  The dialog is unintentionally hilarious.  It is a mystery to me why so many people read  Cussler.  Hey, I'm no literary snob, but even for escapist literature  Sahara is just dreadful.  After I read this book I was inspired to host a  &quot;Clive Cussler&quot; writing contest. Needless to say, the entrants  were better than the inspiration!
