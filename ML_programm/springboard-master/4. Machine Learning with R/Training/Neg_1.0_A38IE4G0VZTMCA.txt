I say that because this book is just Feast of Crows the Second. It's very clear that this author has no interest in writing this series any longer; the plot fumbles for about 100 pages and then I gave up altogether. I do not know if this was ghost written, but it certainly shows that the author will just keep reusing plots for money. Shame on me for buying it without having first read the sample.
