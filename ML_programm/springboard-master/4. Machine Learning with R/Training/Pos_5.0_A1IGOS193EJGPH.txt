Another of Sidney Sheldon's fast paced books with a beautiful heroine that exacts revenge on her enemies, travels the world, becomes a jewel thiefs, gets in/out of tight spots and falls in love!  He's a master at this the type of writing and undoubtedly the best the 80's had to offer in the genre of the ever tough Romance/Heroine/Racy/Revenge Formula Novel.  A great read!
