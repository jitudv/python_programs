This was not what I expect when I read an X-Files novel.I never once felt any sense of urgency or concern for the characters in the book.  Scully and Mulder felt like they were actors being played by people trying to mimic what they saw on the show.  The supporting cast of characters was so bland and undeveloped that when one of them would die I would scratch my head and try to remember just who they were.The "Goblins" were pretty boring too, not much to them other than they could change the color of the skin and they kept stabbing and killing random people.Also, is it just me or did the author spend waaaay too much time talking about what the characters were wearing and what they were eating?
