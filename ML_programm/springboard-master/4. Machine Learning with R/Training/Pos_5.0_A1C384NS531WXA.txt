First and foremost, let me quote reviewer &quot;dan x&quot;: ...&quot;I did a little research and found that this book is the first in a series for fictional detective Alex Cross. (I hate to read a series out of order, even  if the stories are independent and don't continue from book to book.)&quot;I also did some research and came up with the same results as he did,  and I too, hate reading books out of sequence. It is indeed, a very fast  and engrossing read that has pretty much of everything in it. I will  doubtlessly look forward to reading future Alex Cross novels, there's no  doubt about that. If they are anywhere near as good as &quot;Along Came a  Spider&quot; was, then they're excellent.
