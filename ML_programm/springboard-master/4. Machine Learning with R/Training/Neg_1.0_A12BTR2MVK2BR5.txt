I can see why people would love this book, but it wasn't for me. Having read and fallen in love with the Farseer Trilogy, and then the Tawny Man Trilogy, I was thrilled to hear of another series set in the same world, and ordered book one of the Liveship Traders immediately.I got to about page 60, before I really decided to give up. Knowing that there was a whole other two books as well as this one, and not at all enjoying much of it so far, I decided not to waste my time.The problem with this book is that it reads, mostly, like a collection of character profiles and backstories. Huge, huge info-dumps. It's called character development, I suppose, but it's not at all how I like to see characters established.The writing was good, excellent, as is Hobb's standard. But I was bored, immensely so. And there just didn't seem to be an actual plot that was important enough to hold my interest. Everything felt like a kinda side-story, but I'm not sure where the meat and action was supposed to be.I was very much dissapointed having expected great things from this series after reading Farseer. But Liveship is completely different and not nearly as good.
