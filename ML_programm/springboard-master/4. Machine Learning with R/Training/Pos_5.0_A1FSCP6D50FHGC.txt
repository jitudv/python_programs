I have tried assorted &quot;devotional&quot; books before, but I have never been satisfied. All too often, commentaries on specific Bible passages seem to conflict with the very passage they are trying to explain or illustrate, and devotional works which are intended to stand on their own tend to be too sickly-sweet for me, or have questionable theology from time to time.But of course, this is C.S. Lewis. Walter Hooper has arranged some of Lewis' pithier passages into a series roughly paralleling the Church Year as observed by Anglicans. I read it in parallel with my own Bible reading, and was somewhat bemused to find how often what Lewis wrote meshed with what I was reading in the Bible, even though I made no attempt to coordinate or harmonise the two. This is a &quot;devotional book&quot; with which I can be satisfied.
