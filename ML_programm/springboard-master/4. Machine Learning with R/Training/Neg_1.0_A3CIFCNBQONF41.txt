If OK magazine and Penthouse had been writing in the 1500's this is what they would have come up with.First, it is a badly written book.  It is essentially bad Tudor porn.  No characters are well written, and they are all insufferable.  Honestly they couldn't behead Anne fast enough for me.  Even Mary, who should have been the heroine/likeable one was a winy, annoying character.Second, if you're going to make it up just call it fiction and don't try to pass it off as history.  Do some basic research.  If I can refute the basic "facts" of your book in 5 minutes with Google, it's not history in any sense of the word.This book does not deserve to be a best seller, she does not deserve to be identified as an historical fiction writer.  I look at author recommendations on books, and if she recommends it I put it down and move on.
