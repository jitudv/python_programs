The first 4 books, all well written, came to no conclusions, except for the characters that were killed off. -- This book isn't as well written - revealed very little story and less conclusions to the story began.  The whole thing feels like a ploy to make more money, without offering any reader satisfaction. - I have to confess that having read over two thousand of Martins pages, and being a real GoT fan (computer games,TV series, etc.)it was all a gigantic disappointment - but at least I won't be looking forward future books of his, I was a sucker, but I'm done.
