There is a reason that 40% of reviews of ADWD are 1 or 2 stars.  As good as A Game of Thrones is wonderful this book is so uninteresting that I couldn't wait to stop reading it: picking it up now and then, like any addict, hoping for a fix that never comes or satisfies.  The trajectory of this series is much like that of free falling object. If the first couple of books hadn't sucked me in I'd have stopped reading this one in the middle, much like I was quick to jettison Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time which at least kept my interest for 5 books. This much I know: If Martin ( who is as far from being an American Tolkien as the nearest blackhole is from earth) doest wrap this abomination up in book six I won't even bother to finish.  I can't imagine that Martin in his heart of hearts truly believes this work comes within light years of approaching A Game of Thrones.  Maybe we are expecting too much and Martin is just another one hit wonder.  You can't help but wonder if he is dragging this out for the money.
