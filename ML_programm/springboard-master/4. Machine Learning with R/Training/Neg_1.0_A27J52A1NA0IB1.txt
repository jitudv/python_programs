After two hundred and fifty pages of waiting for the protagonist to do something, do anything even remotely worthy of our spending time with him, I finally gave up. It's shocking that this is what has become of American literature. It's the Oprah factor. "Oh, isn't it so romantic that this guy makes out with the bad guy's wife while the bad guy beats the elephant with a stick with a nail in it." This guy allows the elephant to be beaten on a daily basis and he's a vet and he does nothing. I don't know, maybe in the shocking ending we find out that this wimp didn't really exist or something like that, but I couldn't read another page where this ineffectual non-hero continued to do absolutely nothing. Zero. Just imagine "Grapes of Wrath" except Tom Joad turns a blind eye to workers being beaten so he can sneak around with a married woman and call her by her first name in 90% of the sentences in which he speaks to her.If you love animals of any kind, you will hate this protagonist. This book is worse than "Cold Mountain."
