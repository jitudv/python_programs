As with the other reviewers that gave this work a low rating, I am also a fan.Perhaps, as some have said, it is the departure from the much loved Poirot, Marple and even Tommy and Tuppence that makes this a less than enjoyable read.In any event, the book started out fine but soon found its' way into a plot that was so convoluted and unbelievable that I finally gave up.I did skip to the end and found that even there, the wrap-up was nothing that gave me reason to regret the time I saved by not reading the remainder of the book.
