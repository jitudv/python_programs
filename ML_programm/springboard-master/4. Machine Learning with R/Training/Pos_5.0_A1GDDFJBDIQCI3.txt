This just popped into my review folder. I read this book many years ago but, Without Remorse is perhaps my favorite book of all time. This was written back when Clancy did all his own writing and research and it shows. While in the beginning you may ask yourself, why do I need to understand how to tie a bowline or a clove hitch for example, you will find out as you read that you are being lead down a path of understanding that makes the story rich and visual. For anyone who wants to know how John Clark began and how he became such a bad*ss this explains it all in the most brilliant work Tom Clancy has ever produced.
