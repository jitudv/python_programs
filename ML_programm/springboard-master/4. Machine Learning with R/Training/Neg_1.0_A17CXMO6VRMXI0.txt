I am appalled by how many people thought this was a good book.  If you are looking for fiction, fine, but this book should not be called historical if it is referring to Anne Boleyn. As I read the reviewers who rated this book four or five stars I realized that few of them knew anything at all about Anne Boleyn, Henry the VIII, the Tudor era, or even how to write a decent novel. Many other reviewers have delineated this book's shortcomings (look for Carol's review from August 2004) so I won't go into it all, but there is one thing I do want to say.  If you are a person who has read a  book called  historical fiction, I would caution you against reviewing that book unless you actually know something about the subject.  It makes you - especially the reviewer who said she was a teacher! - look like an idiot.There is nothing historical about this story except in a very broad way. If you want to know the true story and don't want to read real history, then check out the BBC miniseries - "The Six Wives of Henry VIII" or the Richard Burton movie - "Anne of a Thousand Days"
