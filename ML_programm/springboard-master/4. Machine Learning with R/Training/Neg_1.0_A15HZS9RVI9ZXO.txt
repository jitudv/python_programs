I could not help but put this book down. I must be fair and note that perhaps I have merely grown out of the insipidity that the fantasy industry thrives on, but disclaimers aside, this series is still terrible. The plot is implausible (and that is truly saying something for a fantasy novel (being inherently implausible)), and the writing is amateurish. Honestly, I was confused when I begin reading this-perhaps I had mistaken the author's name on the cover? Unfortunately, no, but I surmise that this is some of Kay's earliest work, and it is apparent. The Fionavar Tapestry demonstrates none of the laudable elements of Kay's later writing. So, if you're interested in Guy Gavriel Kay, avoid this awful example of writing and check out some of his later books (the Sarantine Mosaic was excellent).
