This is one of the best books I've read recently.  It spans the life of a woman kidnapped from Africa as a child and follows her journey from the ship that brought her into slavery through her old age,as she becomes a much sought after and respected woman of letters.  The author has sprinkled the book with historical facts throughout and woven a tapestry of such compelling characters that I got lost in the book and couldn't put down.  I recommend this book highly.
