Jane Goodall is the most talented woman whose love of animals brought her out to Africa. She observed so many things never witnessed by anyone before!  As she knows the calls of the chimpanzies, I also would howl with my coyotes here in the desert. Her love of animals came quite early as did mine. This book is a great document of her many years with the animals in Gombe and her struggles there. Jane is an amazing woman and leader in protecting our wild places.
