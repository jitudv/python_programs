He fancies himself Tolkein, however he's just another wannabe even going so far as to add the second "R" to his name. He even borrows some things from LOTR for example his "Kings Moot" compared to Tolkeins "Ent Moot". Tolkein was smart keeping the story moving and ending it in three books. Martin will be lucky to finish in seven books if at all. The fourth book was very disappointing because what happened to all the characters?????? I gave it one star should be a 0 since I'm done now, I've lost interest and won't buy any more.
