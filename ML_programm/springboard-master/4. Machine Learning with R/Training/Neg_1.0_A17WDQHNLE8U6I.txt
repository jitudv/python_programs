After recently discovering and enjoying the wonderful TV series starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers, I found myself on a bit of a Tudor wave so, looking for good books, I've read "Wolf Hall", which was beyond amazing and "The Other Boleyn Girl", which was... well... for lack of new words that would have to be invented to describe this "novel", I'll have to settle for s-star-star-t.The book is supposed to be about the life and times of Mary Boleyn, the (younger? why not! poetic license and all that) sister of the more famous Anne, and is written in her POV.I could not even finish it, dragging myself through half the pages, until conceding defeat, for even someone only fleetingly familiar with the period, like myself, found some of the goings-on so outrageously invented that I almost wanted to cry out 'no way could this happen!'.The only redeeming value of this piece of.... literature is the easy writing and the sometimes witty and clever lines.Perhaps I have been spoiled by the magnificent historical novels, with real historical characters at the center, I have read previously, like "Masters of Rome" series or the Cicero Trilogy or "Wolf Hall", but I also have read enough Dumas to recognize when the power of imagination is going just far enough and when it is preposterous.Or perhaps it's just the author's ambition and pretension that got in the way - had she but categorized her book as 'a romance novel taking place in the Renaissance period' or 'a book like those nauseating ones with men dressed like pirates on the cover' or anything else really, but not a 'historical novel'. I personally would not have been tempted to read it then.To sum up, this is nothing more than a glorified self-insert RPF (Real Person Fanfiction) and I would not recommend it to anyone over 15 years old.
