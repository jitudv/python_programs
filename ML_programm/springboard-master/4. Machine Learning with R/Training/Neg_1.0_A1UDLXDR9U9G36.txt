Unlike the many readers who started this series and had to wait for years to read the next book, I bought and read the first 4 and only waited a month to read this one. I will not be waiting for nor purchasing any further books in this series.Mr. Martin put together an interesting cast of characters. He developed them quite well. I became vested in their stories. I feel like I have been betrayed by the author through the deaths of some of them. Every book loses characters through conflict, that's what makes the story more real and more interesting at times. However, manipulating the story line to make it seem that things are going one way, only to chop down the character instead, is something I feel is wrong.Throughout the series, the tenor of the books has become increasingly dark. Things have become more violent, sadistic and crude. I found that more and more disconcerting. It may be that Mr. Martin feels that this fits in better with today's society and its tastes. I hope not. I have been reading fantasy for almost 50 years. There is some really great stuff out there, but I'm done with Mr. Martin.
