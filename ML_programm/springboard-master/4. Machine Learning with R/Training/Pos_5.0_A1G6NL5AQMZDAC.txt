Reading this book is like being buried under a mountain of ashes, one shovelful at a time.Gilbert's strategy is simple and effective. He provides a matter-of-fact outline of daily events, in chronological order, beginning in the early 1930s with the rise of the Third Reich and ending in 1946 with the persecution of post-war Jews in Poland. Places, numbers and (when known) key names are provided, along with hundreds of quotations from letters and journals. After dozens and dozens of increasingly repulsive and nearly-unbelievable chapters, the cumulative effect is simply devastating.It's impossible to read this book and not view the behavior of modern Israel in a new light.The treatment the Jews of Europe endured under the Nazis and their enablers has cast a shadow over human history that will endure for centuries. As the remaining survivors pass away, it is clearly the duty of thoughtful people everywhere to study and contemplate this heartbreaking calamity.I am forever changed by reading this book.
