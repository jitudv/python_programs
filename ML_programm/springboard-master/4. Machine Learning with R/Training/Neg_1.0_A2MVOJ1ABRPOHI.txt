I don't mind books that are slow moving, but my patience is being tested with this series.While ADWD at least fixes one of the major problems with AFfC since it does include the POVs of popular characters like Jon, Bran and Dany, each character faces more and more challenges and failures.  But it doesn't seem to be leading to anything. It's just going on and on with new secondary plots being introduced, but the overall plot of the series is no closer to any resolution.Like a AFfC, there are still too many random characters with POV chapters that add nothing to the overall story other than filler.  I found myself skimming over some chapters because they simply weren't compelling and I had no interest in what was going on.At the end of ADWD, I was left with a lack of hope for both the characters and the storyline.  It's now a series of disjointed storylines with the empty promise of a satisfying conclusion.With only two books left, I have my doubts about how the series will wrap up. But I'm fully expecting GRRM to announce that ASoIaF will be a 10 book series now.
