Wouldn't you think that after reading the boring book four I'd have had the brains enough not to buy book 5? In my own defense I have to say that somewhere or other I got the notion that book 5 would end the series, and so I bought it, just to see how it ended. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that this waste of time and money still has two more books to go before the series mercifully ends.I have managed to wade through 300 pages of A Dance with Dragons and cannot bring myself to finish this seemingly endless mess of going nowhere. I almost said "going nowhere fast," but in fact, A Dance with Dragons goes nowhere painfully sloooowly.What happened to the forward momentum that drove the first three books? What happened to characters we care about? What happened to--oh, never mind, if I keep this up it'll end up as long-winded as the book.
