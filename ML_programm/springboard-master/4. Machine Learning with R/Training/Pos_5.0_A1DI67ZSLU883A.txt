In her own words, Jane Goodall writes of her landmark studies of wild chimpanzees at the Gombe Stream Reserve in Tanzania. Starting out in 1960, Goodall, a student of legendary anthropologist Louis Leakey, set out for Tanzania to set up the first long-term research study on chimpanzees in the wild.Overcoming political strife, harsh living conditions, lacks of funding, and the initial mistrust of the animals themselves, Goodall's work grew into a remarkable long-term scientific achievement. Goodall went on to devote more than forty years of work to the study of what many believe is mankind's closest evolutionary relative.This book covers her early years, setting up the camp, establishing a rapport with the animals, and learning about chimpanzee society and behavior. She describes her own experiences as well as the experiences of several chimps that she had the experience of following closely as they lived and grew in the Gombe Stream Reservation.Goodall names the animals, and relates story after story of their personalities and their conflicts. She uncovers the dominance hierarchy of chimp society, and traces the changing leadership of the community. Goodall was the first to observe tool-making behavior in Chimpanzees, and she relates the excitement of that early discovery.In spite of her obvious affection for the animals she is studying, Goodall does not hold back when it comes to describing the brutality of some aspects of chimpanzee biology and society. She observed first-hand the devastating results of a polio epidemic on the local chimps, and she doesn't shrink from dealing with issues of aggression, neglect, and bullying that she oberved.She candidly discusses her own mistakes as well, pondering on the compromises that she made early on to get close to the animals while raising the possibility that she could be altering their behavior by her use of feeding stations and close direct interaction.Goodall's writing style is vivid, intense, and loaded with little details that bring the reader right into her world alongside the chimpanzees. She captures good scientific observations without losing her talent for storytelling, and draws readers into the lives of the chimpanzees whose lives she follows.The book is supplemented by four sections of photographs by Goodall's husband and fellow researcher Hugo van Lawick, and it also includes an appendix with illustrations of chimpanzee facial expressions and behaviors. Stephen Jay Gould writes an excellent introduction to this edition, focusing on the importance of Goodall's work and on the importance of observational technique in the sciences.This is a true classic of scientific writing, and a must-read for anyone interested in the study of animal societies in the wild.
