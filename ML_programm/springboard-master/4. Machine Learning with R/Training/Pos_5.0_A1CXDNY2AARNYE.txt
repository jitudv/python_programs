I love this book.  Not as good as "A Storm of Swords" (wide and away seen as the best in the series so far) or even potentially "A Clash of Kings", but still an awesome book. The book has some high points but feels more like a set-up book than the first three books. Definitely an improvement over "A Feast for Crows" (also a set-up book, but this book does it MUCH better). Basically, the 4th and 5th books are set-up for the 6th and 7th books, but A Dance with Dragons does the set-up in a great way.I can completely understand why fans are divided over this book but still I think this book is awesome and would recommend it to anyone!
