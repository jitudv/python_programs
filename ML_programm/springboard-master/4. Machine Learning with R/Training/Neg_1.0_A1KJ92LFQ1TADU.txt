Don't bother wasting your time if you fell for the drawn-out teaser that was book Four. None of the characters you were following through the first three books and even into the fourth move along here, so there's no point in reading it. Want to find out what happens to Bran and his siblings? (Jon apparently winds up dead, killed by his inner circle. Same fate as too many other characters, ho hum) The other families? All those yarns at loose ends are just left fluttering.Yes, that's correct. No satisfying conclusion awaits and about two dozen NEW characters are added instead, as if the author got tired of the old ones from the first four books and rather move along and then wrap up their stories he just ignored them completely. Not sure which is more disgusting, the sloppy and tedious writing or the utter disrespect to the readers he's dragged along through thousands of pages previously only to arrogantly leave hanging...as if we are all going to rush out for his next book to get what we didn't in this one. Sorry. Fool me once, I might try again. But the final two books were so worthless and the quality so lacking, there isn't any point in bothering with another.Such a shame. These characters and story premise deserved an engaged writer who cared about his craft, not someone just filling pages with the same tediously repetitious situations as if he's tossing darts at a page of the following options: violent and senseless death, introduce new character, boring sex scene, gratuitous violence, introduce new character, implausible escape, introduce new character, or feast scene.
