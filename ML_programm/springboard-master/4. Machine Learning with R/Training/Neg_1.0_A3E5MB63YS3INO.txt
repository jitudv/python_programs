This series DOES NOT qualify George Martin as "the American Tolkien" - a quick review might more accurately say "a book of bad menus, weak plots, plenty of fill to disturb the flow of what little story there is, and overweening characters that are impossible to identify with unless you live your life on a teenage page of Facebook". If you're a reader who thinks Robert Jordan lost his way with the Wheel of Time series, (or may be his editors were milking the money) don't read this book.
