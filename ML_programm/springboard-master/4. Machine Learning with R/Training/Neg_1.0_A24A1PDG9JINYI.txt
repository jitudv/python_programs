The first three were somewhat tiresome but worth reading for the verisimilitude and feel of being there and involved in the plot and the ACTION. I should have known with volume four to quit while I was (barely) ahead. Now, no action except when the author thinks he has just about put you to sleep. The dwarf's humor has even grown trite and banal. Now there are only words, and words, and words, and even more words, put together in no particularly pleasing order. When he killed off yet another Stark (Snow) in a matter of half a page to no good purpose, I almost threw the book at the wall. You sold us out Mr. Martin; most sagas are supposed to have an aim and an end. You are NOT a Tolkien. You have made your pile of money now please go enjoy it somewhere rather than destroy your reputation and our reading pleasure further. Shame, shame, shame!Seth Aragon
