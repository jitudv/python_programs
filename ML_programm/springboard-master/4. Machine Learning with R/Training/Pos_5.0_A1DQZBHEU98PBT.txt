I read this book a few years back, and recently saw the movie.  I'm such a fan of Patterson's, I wanted to include my review.In the first of the Alex Cross series, this story is a race against time to find a kidnapped girl of a famous actress.  Cross is called in to help, and in only the way he can, he finds his way to the end of this suspenseful ride.  Not only will you enjoy the writing which propells the suspense and mystery, but you'll also enjoy the character development.  It leaves you wanting more of Alex Cross, one of my most favorite detectives of all time!I definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading thrillers.  I'll warn you though, like me, after you read this book, you'll be off to the store or library to pick up many more books by James Patterson.
