This book was one of the most uninteresting books that I have ever read.  I am not a fantasy book reader but I saw the reviews so I thought I would give this book a try.  I really thought that there were way too many characters in this book.I will admit that it was really helpful that the author did put together a listing of who is who.  Maybe it is because I am not an avid fantasy reader but I just found myself extremely bored reading this book.  The 5 main characters did not interest me along with the storyline.  After reading this book I will not read another fantasy book for a long time.
