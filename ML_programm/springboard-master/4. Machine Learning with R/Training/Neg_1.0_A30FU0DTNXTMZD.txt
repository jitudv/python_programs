The author appears to be using a Soap Opera formula. You know where you watch the episode for 30 minutes and the plot progresses for about 15 seconds or not at all. I kept wondering, is this some form of writers ADD or has George gotten hopelessly lost in his own story lines. Too bad, this could have been a epic series, some of the story lines are fascinating and the character's rich but it has fallen and it can't get up.
