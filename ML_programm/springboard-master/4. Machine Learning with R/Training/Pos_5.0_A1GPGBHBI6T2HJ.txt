I'm a lifelong Cussler fan since the late 70's when I first read 'Raise The Titanic' and felt (and still feel) that it was one of the best adventure stories written.  Cussler seems to never write a bad story...however some are just better than others. 'Sahara' is one such story.  From the opening pages when a Confederate Ironclad takes on a mysterious guest and set's sail to places unknown...to the deadly plague seeping into the ocean off the coast of Africa threatening to destroy all sea life... to a really nasty bad guy (who really get's what is coming to him ala Pitt's fiendish imagination...) this has just about anything and everything an adventure novel should have.  I read somewhere recently that Cussler isn't the Sultan of Suspense, he's the Emperor of Action and I'd have to agree.  Swift plotting with a cast of characters you just GOTTA like and a story worthy of Cussler's best.  I particularly enjoyed Pitt &amp; Giordino's travails through the desert near death, and their discovery there.  As a true Dirk Pitt fan, I urge you to get to know this guy.  Bigger, better and more creative than James Bond, Pitt is more like a cross between Bond &amp; an ocean-going Indiana Jones. You get the best of nifty gadgets plus the swashbuckling adventure that makes Indiana Jones so fun--it's ALL HERE and in abundance, too.  Another discovery in the desert is also worth the price of the book, too.  'Sahara' is a fantastic fun yarn and one YOU need to take as soon as possible.  Trust me, you'll be glad you did.
