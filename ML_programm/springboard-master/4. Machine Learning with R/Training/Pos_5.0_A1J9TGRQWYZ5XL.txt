I first came across this book when I was browsing a tiny library in the building basement a couple of doors down.  I was probably around 10-12 years old and unable to check out the book (don't remember why) so instead I sat down in the stacks and began paging through it.  I absolutely loved looking at all the wonderful photographs and reading the captions, etc.  I was so pulled in by Ms Goodall's writings, I found it such an interesting book and it stayed with me all these decades.  I even majored in Anthropology in college, that's how inspired I was by this amazing book.The day I came across In the Shadow of Man, Jane Goodall became my hero.  Nearly forty years later, I still feel drawn to her chimp stories.  I think it's time I buy it to have forever.  Happy 80th Birthday, Ms Goodall.
