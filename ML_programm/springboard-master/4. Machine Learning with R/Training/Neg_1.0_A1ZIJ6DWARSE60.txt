But that is not to say there is nothing good about this book.  The epilogue was simply brilliant and unfortunately the story line got worse from then on.  I bought a book being told that I was going to be reading a courtroom thriller/drama with elements of the supernatural.  To a small extent this is true, however &quot;Lost Girls&quot; is far more about the main character's cocaine addiction than a supernatural tale.  Written in the first person but in an intensely irritating passive tense (&quot;I walk across the street.  Rain splashes on my face&quot; and so on) &quot;Lost Girls&quot; actually becomes very slow reading the more you go on.  Compared with the excellent  epilogue this is a let down indeed.The rest of the time that Crane is not discussing whether to have &quot;one line of snow or two&quot;, we are treated to the other characters in the book.  Most are so stereotypically bland as to be of no interest at all. Thomas Tripp, the accused, is by far and away the most cardinal of character sinners as Pyper tries desperately to portray a horrific fiend of mental imbalance when the effect is somewhat nearer to a sad old man who has simply had enough. Then there is McConnell, the filibustering parent of one of the missing girls and Crane's associates, Pyper's caricatures rather than characterisation of one excessively camp, gay man and one excessively large, unpleasant and rude man.  I doubt very much if Pyper has met the like of either.So in total we are talking about a book initially brilliant which overplods to a totally unsatisfactory ending which takes far, far too many pages to get to.  And that does not even touch on the disappointment of the central supernatural legend that comes straight out of the &quot;Blair Witch Project.&quot;No.  My only advice is do not waste your money and your time.
