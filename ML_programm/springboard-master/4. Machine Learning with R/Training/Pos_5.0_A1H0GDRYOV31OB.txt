Hemingway has written a masterpiece, weaving together the human with the politics of the war in a tapestry richly layered.  The evocation of Robert Jordan's love for Maria is poignant and convincing.  The existential threat facing everyone is played out according to their moral stance and passion.  The climax of the book is an exquisite melding together of everything that came before.I reread it after many years while in Spain, a fortuitous experience.  The final passage brought me to tears.
