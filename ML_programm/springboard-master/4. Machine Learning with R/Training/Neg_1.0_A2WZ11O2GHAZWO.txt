I love This series so much. George R.R. martin is just an amazing writer and I have a great deal of respect for his obvious passion for detail and creation of substantive charterers.That said I was somewhat disappoint by A dance with dragons. After several years of waiting after having left off on several cliff hangers I was hoping that this volume would make the wait so worth it and I was so thrilled to get my copy.Sadly that wasn't the case.without giving away any spoilers, not that there were many to be honest. the book was a slow ambling drag that teased at upcoming moments of excitement and revelation but never actually got to any.It may as well have been a travelogue since all the characters mainly did was tour the scenery and wait around a lot.It's sad cause the others in the series I would have to force myself to put the book down and go to bed. This one actually put me to sleep and I had to force myself to keep plodding through it to the end.around page 500 I stopped expecting the story lines to progress and began to accept this book was not going anywhere. It was like someone took a movies b-roll and used it as filler to make a faux sequel to cash in on a franchise.I'm so disappointed.I don't know if Mr. Martin is just tired of the series and gave up or if he just isn't sure what to do next so he kept typing words until he reached the word count cut off point.I honestly don't know if I have another 5 year wait in me so I think from now on I'll just watch the HBO show and leave off on the books.Anyone know of any good series I can replace this one with? I'm open to suggestions.
