The red planet comes to life in this brilliantly conceived and stunninglyexecuted novel from Kim Stanley Robinson.  The story opens with a brutalmurder that takes place amidst the buzz of the annual festival.  From there,we go on an extended flashback that describes how the original 100 settlers(a sampling of the world's brightest, if not necessarily most stable minds)first colonized Mars.  Summarizing their training, we get to know many ofthe personalities intimately on the long voyage out, and as the initialsettlement is established.  Like Faulkner, Robinson changes the point ofview with each section to give a variety of viewpoints on what was done andwhy, allowing the reader to decide who is right and who is wrong.  Returningto the present, we see the fruits of their labors: several domed cities,thousands of residents, a working space elevator (based on the Arthur C.Clarke design), and a radical genetic treatment that will vastly alter whatit means to be human.  But there are dangers present as well, and theresulting catastrophe makes for an unforgettable climax to a masterfullytold story.There's a lot to love about this book: the painstakingly detaileddescriptions of the Martian landscape, the attendant environmental concerns,the even more pressing psychosocial problems, the mysteries of the stowawayand the lost colony and the assassination all work together to form a Marsthat is more alive than any other.  The powerful personalities at play inthis story, and their failure to come to terms with the greater issues atstake, set this book apart from everything else in the field.  A simplyoverwhelming experience that doesn't let up through 500 pages; this reviewerread it in less than a week, it was so gripping.  Some day, man may reallytry to conquer the planets, but for today, Red Mars is the next best thingto being there.
