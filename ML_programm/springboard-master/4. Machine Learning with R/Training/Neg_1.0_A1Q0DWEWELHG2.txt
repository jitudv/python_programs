Martin insists that he's got everything under control, that plot isn't the be-all and end-all, that he is equally concerned with "character development" and "world-building", that his epic is "resting", as with Tolkien in The Two Towers.Really?In The Two Towers, Tolkien (the genuine article, not the "American" counterfeit) manages to develop plot, character, and build his world (including several races and languages) simultaneously, and while he's "resting", he chronicles a major battle at Helm's Deep, the destruction of Isengard and the overthrow of Saruman, and Frodo's fight with Shelob and subsequent capture by the Orcs. And all in 400 pages.This is "resting"?Martin is not the "American Tolkien" nor any other kind of Tolkien. He is, if anything, the prose equivalent of Yanni, perpetual middle and no end. Those who love this kind of work -- stylistically similar to The Osbournes, The Kardashians, New Jersey Housewives, even The Sopranos (particularly if Tony had been killed during the first season) -- will likely love this, and will continue to do so as the characters, plots, venues and volumes multiply.Martin had a promising first act, but the literary world is replete with promises that quickly fizzle. Perhaps the publishers could give the series a title more fitting to lowered expectations: Westeros Housewives.
