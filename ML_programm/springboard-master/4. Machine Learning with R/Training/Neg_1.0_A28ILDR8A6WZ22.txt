... I... Why GRRM? Why? I officially hate this series. Book one was fantastic. It was suspenseful, had good characters, great plot twists, a good (Though extremely flawed) world, and a good storyline. I didn't like book 2, I thought it was boring and drawn out, but it wasn't a bad book, I just didn't like it. Book three is amazing. It's one of the best fantasy books ever, and surpassed by few (Particularly Tolkien). Book four was a piece of garbage. I hate to admit it exists. But could book five be the next A Storm Of Swords? Well, it could've been, but it sure as hell isn't. I can't decide whether or not I hate A Feast For Crows, or A Dance With Dragons more. They are both awful books. I hate to see A Song Of Ice And Fire come to this. Books 1-3 are amazing. But now it's a drawn out, poorly written, piece of crap.
