I'm an X-Files fan and I saw this in Indigo, so I bought it. And what a waste of money!!! Not only is this poorly written, but characters are poorly developed. Mulder spends his time checking girls out, and you can see Charles Grant must be obsessed with Scully, because 75% of the book is about Scully. Most of the chapters start with "Scully", and Mulder is in mostly the non-important parts. Yeah, I think Scully is hot too! Can we move on please? Plus what was with all the swearing? The only time they'd cuss in the show was in the episode "Bad Blood" (where they use the S-word right at the very beginning), and even the ending doesn't make any sense.I'm not going to say another word, this is just trash.
