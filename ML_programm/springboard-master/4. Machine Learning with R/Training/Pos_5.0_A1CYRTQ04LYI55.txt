Hemmingway transcribes his expat experiences in the Spanish American war into a gripping story of the futility of combat.  The main characters hide in the hills struggling between loyalty to their anti-fascist cause, and the scars caused by the attrocities they've experienced.For whom the bell tolls, as we all know, "It tolls for thee!" This summarizes the story.  To Hemmingway, war is futile.  We all lose.  Agree or disagree with the morality, the story captures Hemmingway's ability to lay emotions bare with strong minimalist prose and dialogure.
