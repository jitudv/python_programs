This book was the biggest crock of terrible historical fiction I've even had the misfortune to read. A friend lent it to me, knowing of my love for all things Tudor. A waste of paper and time--with each terrible page my blood pressure increased notch by notch. It wasn't even well written! By weaving her mis-information into this story, Ms. Gregory will only keep people whom are unfamiliar with Anne Boleyn's life even more ignorant of the facts. Historical fiction doesn't mean "change the story around to whatever you want." I've read some really great historical fiction where the author RESEARCHES the FACTS to try and tell a possible version of the truth. Not so here. So don't waste your money. Why do authors find it necessary to write for the lowest common denominator? It should have no stars.
