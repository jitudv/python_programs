I do not really understand how could all of the reviewers recommend this book. I did not think it was that good it was rather slow and sorry to say boring.If you have read many books by Agatha Christie and want to read  this book go ahead but you might not like because it is not so  thrilling.If you really want to read some good stuff by Mrs Christie go  for &quot;The Secret adversery&quot; a tommy and Tuppence mystery it is not  really bad and you might like it.If you want to read good mysteries I  would recommend Georges Simenon's Maigret's Novels they are really good and  M. Simenon is big time better than Mrs Christie (sorry to say that but try  and see)
