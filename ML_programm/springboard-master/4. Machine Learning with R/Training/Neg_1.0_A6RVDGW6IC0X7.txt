Martin admits in the acknowledgments that this book "was three bitches and a bastard" to write. If you can withstand boredom on an epic scale, you can see why.  Too many characters, too little action, and far, far too much musing about the past or what may or may not happen in the future.  Very little of any consequence happens in over 900 pages.  I had hoped that after the "Crows" fiasco the author would get back on track.  Unfortunately, GRRM went even further off the rails.
