I love science fiction and I was excited they offered a few different books for free for the Kindle. I was interested in finding some new authors to read...I will not be reading this one again.I didn't finish the entire book which is rare for me. I'm an avid reader and I can read quickly- this book was like quicksand. The deeper I got into the book the more I wanted out. I couldn't finish the book b/c it was so freaking boring. I've read a lot of science fiction and am tolerant of very descriptive passages but I kept on thinking this would of been better as a movie rather than a book and that is a first for me. The author gets so completely weighed down in his descriptions- images would of sufficed! Wtf...where was the editor on this one? I really dislike rating a book poorly b/c I realize that enjoying a book is largely subjective but I could not stand this one.
