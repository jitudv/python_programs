I really dislike everyone in this book. I'll pass on criticizing the weak writing & the obvious lack of credible research (various other one star reviews have covered that) and instead attack the characters: Jacob is a stupid d**che, Marlena is a stupid tw*t, and August is just an a-hole.Jacob is supposed to be a vet/animal caretaker but what does he do? He lets August repeatedly beat the bejeesus out of Rosie, the elephant. But as soon as Marlena, August's tw*tty wife, appears with a black eye Jacob goes bonkers and attacks August. Okay... Really?! I'm not brushing off wife-beating here, but really?! One flipping black eye and August deserves to die? I would have killed that bastard for beating AND torturing Rosie LONG BEFOREHAND!! And then Jacob keeps harping about it: "He hit her! He hit her! He hit her!" Well, so what? It's not like she was tied to a stake like Rosie was. And the only reason she had the black eye was because August thought she was having an affair with Jacob! And then the author uses "paranoid schizophrenia" to explain August's behavior? Seriously?! He's just a possessive prick! With good reason to be "paranoid," turns out, since Jacob really IS after his wife.The only main character that wasn't completely unlikable, really, was Walter aka Kinko but Jacob got him killed by being *gasp!* a stupid d**che.I'm not surprised this book is so popular, though. It's a simple, easy read with little to no thinking required.
