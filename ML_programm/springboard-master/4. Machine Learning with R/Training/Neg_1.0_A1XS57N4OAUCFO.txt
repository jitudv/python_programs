I am a natural speed reader & just received a Kindle for Christmas. I have been downloading favorites to the Kindle & just spent a few hours re-reading Clancy's "Executive Orders". The experience was totally spoiled by the HUNDREDS of typos, most typically "c" for "e" and vice versa. It really ruined the experience of reading a 2041KB (896 pg) book. Didn't anyone ever hear of SPELLCHECK? The book was FIVE STARS but the printing was awful.
