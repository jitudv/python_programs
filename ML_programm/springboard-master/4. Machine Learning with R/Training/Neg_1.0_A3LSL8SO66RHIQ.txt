I'm sure the 7 short stories by Agatha Christie are excellent as usual.  The problem is that if you are looking for the Audio Edition read by JOAN HICKSON, this is NOT read by her.  Amazon is listing that she reads it, but this information is incorrect.  If you look carefully at the picture provided it shows that it is read by Geraldine McEwan.  This may be a fine rendition, but it is not THE Miss Marple as performed by Joan Hickson in audio and TV performances.
