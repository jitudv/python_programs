This series started out wonderful, I loved the 1st two book and the 3rd was ok. This one and the 4th one were terrible. The problem is there are too many characters, too much unnecessary dialogue, and the biggest problem is the plot is moving too slow. At this rate the story wont be nearly finished in book 7. Maybe if books came out every year this wouldnt be a problem, but they only come out every 4 or 5 years. I am really mad bc this series was soo good at the beginning.
