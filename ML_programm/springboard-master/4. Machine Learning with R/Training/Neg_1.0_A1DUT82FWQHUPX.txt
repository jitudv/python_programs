I am an Army veteran and I can tell you, Mr. Clancy got it all wrong.  I shall now tell you how and why.Mr. Clancy has no first hand knowledge of the military but he has powerful contacts (politicians and generals).  He  makes some calls and gets to look at all the latest gadgetry.  Unfortunately, the high ranking officers briefing him only show him the  best parts.  They gloss over the not so good stuff.  Clancy apparently  falls for it hook line and sinker!Here are some examples.  The laser  stuff at the National Training Center doesnt work near as well as Clancy  describes.  In all of my rotations, I never had laser equipment that  worked.  Also, the idea of two training regiments and a national guard  brigade making a cohesive fighting division is ludicrous.  Finally, such a  cobbled together unit could never steamroller an Iraqi/Iranian Army ten  times its size as Clancy describes.This is probably the end of the road  for me.  Unless Mr. Clancy gets back the magic he used to have.  This will  be the last of his books I will read.
