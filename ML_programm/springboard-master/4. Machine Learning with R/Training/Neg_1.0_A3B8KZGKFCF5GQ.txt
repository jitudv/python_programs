Why has this book been highly rated by national critics?The answer is because George RR Martin continues to astound us with his world building. And that is what critics love. They want a book immersed in the minute details, they want to be able to imagine themselves in the book. They want to smell the smells, eat the food, and watch the sights. And this book delivers that in droves. Add a dash of oppressiveness and this book becomes an instant classic amongst the criticatti.This is also precisely the reason I hate this book. There is too much detail, and this is not what I (as a fan) do not want to read. Is this a food guide or fantasy fiction? I would rather watch the Food Network than read about the excrutiating details of each meal. Is this a travelogue or fantasy fiction? I would rather buy Fromer's guide to Westeros than read about the boring nature of traveling from one place to the next where nothing (important) happens in between.As a result, we get hundreds of pages of filler. It delights the critics but it bores the heck out of me. I don't care where whores go nor do I care to read about urinating into rivers.Admittedly, the action picks up 75% into the book, and the last quarter of this book is actually readable. However, this means that 250 pages is actually fairly good and the remaining 700 pages could have been cut out without impacting the book.The saddest part of this is that we will need to wait another five years for "Gorge" RR Martin to write the next installment of the foods that he dreams about.As a huge fan of this series (hey, I have not only the board-game, but the expansion for it!), I'm sad to say that if this were book one, I would not have read book two.
