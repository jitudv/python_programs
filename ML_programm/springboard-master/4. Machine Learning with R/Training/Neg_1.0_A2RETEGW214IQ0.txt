'A Dance With Dragons' drags along at a snail's pace, leaving you literally begging Martin for something interesting to happen.When the few interesting parts do finally occur, you are already too beaten down by overly descriptive minutia to feel that the book has vindicated your hard earned reading time.And seriously, wtf is up with all the food and wine references? I've had my "fill" of Dornish wine. More substance please!I fear that the glory days of the 'A Song Of Ice And Fire' series and those wonderful first three books are long gone. It eerily reminds me of how the 'Star Wars' movies progressed: From entertaining and thrilling stories with characters you actually care about, to painfully tedious boredom.Fool me once (AFFC), shame on you. Fool me twice (ADWD), shame on me.I won't be pulled into buying another installment without being patient and reading the reviews first. Martin may not care about my time and what I feel is enjoyable, but I do.
