I consider myself "ripped off" after receiving this book. I should NOT have pre ordered...will not make this mistake again. This book seems to be edited out material that was thrown together to take advantage of the huge interest generated by the HBO series. I doubt the author ever meant to finish this series but saw the huge paycheck that he would get if he churned out another book. Last book I will buy from this author and last book I will ever preorder.
