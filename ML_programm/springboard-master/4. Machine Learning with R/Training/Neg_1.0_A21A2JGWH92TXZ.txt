I was so looking forward to this novel - a somewhat trashy page-turner with an interesting historical backdrop. Well, it wasn't a page-turner, and the historical backdrop was so far from believable that I had no interest. It was trashy and truly juvenile. Frankly, I'm shocked that so many people have rated this novel highly. If you want a fun, trashy, historical page-turner, try Anne Rice's "Cry To Heaven." That was a guilty pleasure which I loved. "The Other Boleyn Girl" falls miles short.
