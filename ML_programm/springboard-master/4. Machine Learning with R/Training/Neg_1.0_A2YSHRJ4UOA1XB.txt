I am the biggest fan of ASOIAF that you will find. The reason I'm such a big fan however is because of the amazing quality of the first three novels.  I consider A Storm of Swords to be the greatest book I've ever read. A Feast Crows did not live up to the hype and ended up being a massive disappointment. With that said, I still had hope that GRRM could right the ship. Unfortunately, A Dance with Dragons is the worst book he has written yet. It is a book of pointless filler where almost nothing important happens.  Too many chapters are simply unnecessary chapters where the character starts at one point and the chapter ends with him/her still at the same point. There is little development whatsoever with ANY of the characters. There are a few good moments and surprises but not nearly enough to live up to Martin's books.I waited 6 years for this novel and got a 1000 page book in which everything important that took place could have been completely summarized in less than 5 pages. Yes I'm serious, that's how little took place in this book.  Gone are the huge surprises, the big battles and the sense of awe that you used to get while reading these books. When I read the first three books there were many moments where I just had a blank look on my face and thought "Wow". These looks and feelings of awe have been replaced by feelings of boredom and yawns.  ASOIAF looked like it was destined to become the greatest Fantasy series of all time but that has all gone out the window. Martin can still regain it however if he can deliver in the next book unlike with the past two.Martin is still the best fiction writer alive today but if it takes multiple years to release the next book, I'm going to give up on him. It's criminally expensive to buy a hardcover book these days.
