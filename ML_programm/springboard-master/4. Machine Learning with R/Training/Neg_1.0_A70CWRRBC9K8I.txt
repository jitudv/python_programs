When I read a book, there should be characters that I can relate to and care about.  The immaturity of the characters gave the book an 8th grade/soap-opera feel.  There should be a plot that excites.  Not with this book.  It started out good with a murder and landing but it quickly descended into scientific minutae.  I'm not that interested in Mars dust or lunar cycles.  I gave up and didn't finish this book.
