I purchased this book because it won a Nebula award.With all due  respect to Mr. Robinson, this book is dull.  It is a mindnumbingly dull  read because of the endless exposition.  It just goes on and on and on and  it takes forever for anything to happen.You'll either love this book or  hate it.  I didn't like it and I opted not to read the sequels.
