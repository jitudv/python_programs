But the best sleep aid I've ever found.  After reading the reviews, I thought I'd really like this book.  But the plot development is glacial, the character's so pendantic, that out of sheer determination I finished the book (and find the obvious ending that bad guy Holt dies and Angus kills him and the world is saved and Morn gets a medal and a pardon- no, can't make this bad stuff up).My advice. If you are interested in this bloated book, read every 20th page.  I kid-you-not that you miss nothing other than time wasted from your life.Obviously the author was paid by the word.  If one would suffice, twenty were used....Do NOT buy this book unless you have no imagination and have eons of time to kill in worthless pursuit of entertainment.If I could rate this "book" a zero, I would...I HATED THIS BOOK!
