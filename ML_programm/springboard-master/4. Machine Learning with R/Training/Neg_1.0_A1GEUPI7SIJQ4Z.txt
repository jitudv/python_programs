I don't have a well-versed couple of paragraphs for this final book in this series. All I can say is I read the reviews before I bought it...said I would NOT buy it...and then I did...and I should not have. i am only 65% thru the book and at this point...I just want it to end so i can move on to something else. Heed what ur gut is telling u and don't buy it, no matter how much you want to find out about Cersei and Dany....who is a twittering fool who has not accomplished her mission so far.
