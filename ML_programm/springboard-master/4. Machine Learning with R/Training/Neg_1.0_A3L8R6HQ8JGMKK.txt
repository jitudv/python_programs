Though I had enjoyed Clancy's previous techno-thrillers, this one was a  major disappointment.  By making Ryan president, he has painted himself  into a corner that only reliance on Ryan's flimsy alter-ego, John Clark (a  man who will soon be fighting evildoers from a walker if Clancy  acknowledges the passage of time) will allow him to escape from.  Otherwise, how plausible is it for the President of the United States to be  personally getting involved with gun battles with terrorists and drug  runners?  This may not have weakened the novel itself had it not been for  Clancy's interjection of his simplictic politics into his fictional world.  His attempt to define how the world should be run through his characters'  action sapped what remaining enjoyment this novel contained.  Traditional  Clancy fans would be best served by stoppping at "Debt Of Honor"  to let their imaginations work from there rather than the ideological box  Clancy seems bent on constructing.
