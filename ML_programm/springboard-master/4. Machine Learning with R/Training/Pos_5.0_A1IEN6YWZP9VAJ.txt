Even if you are familiar with the Anne Boleyn and Henery VIII saga you will find new intrigue with this captivating book.  Written in first person from the prospective of Mary Boleyn who was intimate with the King years before her sister. This book tells Mary's story with is completely imeshed with her sister Anne's.  The Boleyn family is portrayed in a less then golden light as the family attempts to weave themselves into court life and gain the advantage over the Seymours (ultimately failing).  Anne and Mary are simply pawns in a sick and twisted game.  Anne is very unlikable in this novel however, it's not clear as to rather she is more tragically a causality of her family and the times.  Mary's hostility and love for her sister is as confusing and complex as any sibling relationship.  I celebrate when Mary is able to find true love and break free of the family cycle... if we could all be as strong as Mary perhaps we too will live happily ever after. Enjoy!
