On p. 442, Marshall writes, "Georges Sorel, inspired by by Proudhon and the syndicalists, maintained in his Reflections on Violence (1908) that class war invigorates society. He opposed 'bourgeois force', arguing that the latter has a purifying effect that enables people to take possession of themselves. The general strike moreover is of value as a 'social myth', an article of faith which inspires the workers in their struggle. For Sorel, social myths are important since they are 'not descriptions of things, but expression of a determination to act'. Although he later influenced Lenin, Mussolini and Action Franaise, he did not object to acknowledging himself an anarchist since 'Parliamentary Socialism professes a contempt for morality' and the new  ethic of the producers."Mr Marshall, as a historian of anarchism, seems to share their indifference to facts.Sorel did not influence Lenin. Lenin called Sorel `the well-known advocate of confusion'. The Marxist historian of philosophy George Lukacs referred to Sorel's `totally insubstantial theory of myth'. So it is a bit of a stretch for Marshall to write that Lenin was influenced by Sorel.This mistake is typical of this unreliable book. It is careless of the facts, even about its subject, and still more unreliable about any other politics.
