This great novel is the best description of World War II that the average person will ever find. You could read Churchill's Memoirs, as I have, or Max Hastings non-fiction "Overlord." You would have to read at least a dozen non-fiction books to get the story. I have probably read 50 books on World War II. I have also read Winds of War a dozen times. Pug Henry is the observer and minor participant that has been used by many other historical novelists. WEB Griffin is an enormously popular writer of novels on World War II. I have read them all. He is excellent at characterization. Wouk is better. There are many excellent novels about World War II that have been forgotten. Leon Uris wrote several of them and they are excellent. Wouk is better. If you want the story of World War II in one story, read this novel and the sequel War and Remembrance. I have read each of them many times. There is no better way to get the whole story. I have amused myself with looking up the stories of the real characters he includes. They are all real and he does them justice.There is no better way to start the study of World War II.
