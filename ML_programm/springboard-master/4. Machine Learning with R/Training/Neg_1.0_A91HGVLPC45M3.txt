Like many I came to this series when HBO premiered A Game of Thrones.I'm disappointed for 2 reasons:1. I bought this book for $14.95 for my Kindle (I thought I'd save money with a Kindle, you know?).2. This book ENDED WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEGUN!I will not read GRRM anymore, cuz he ain't getting anymore of my time nor hard earned money....
