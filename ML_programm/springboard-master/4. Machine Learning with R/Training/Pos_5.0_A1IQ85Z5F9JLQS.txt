I'd been hearing a lot of rave reviews of this book in the writer's groups that I'm in (ALL rave reviews, as a matter of fact) and when I heard that the movie was due out soon, I purchased the e-book now so that I could compare the book to the movie. There are so many great things about this book, when you put it all together, it was just one of the best books I've ever read.The point of view for Water for Elephants is unique. Jacob, the main character, comes to us first as a 90 (or is it 93?) year old man who is living in a seniors home. Most of the story is Jacob recalling his life with the circus, with short trips back to his here-and-now. I felt that I came to know all of Jacob. From his beginning, losing his parents in an accident, to his experience with the circus and his true love, to his last days feeling trapped in a body and mind that he wasn't free to control himself any longer.With the story being set in the 1930's and in the Depression, the book was even more interesting to read about days in that era. At the end of the book, the author describes all of her research that she's done for her book. It's obvious by how thoroughly and well written Water for Elephants is.I highly, HIGHLY recommend this book!!!
