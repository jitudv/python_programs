All the reviewers are correct. I was a bit skptical at first. One of the greatest tales ever told. If you like 'Vikings' on the History Channel, YOU'LL LOVE THIS!Adventure, love, betrayal, gold! Even the most jaded reader will find this enjoyable. A real page turner that'll keep yo up at night...Enjoy~!
