I confess that the only reason I first picked up this book was that it was a required text for an English course I was taking. Once I started it, however, I found I couldn't put it down!Langston Cane V, a man of mixed race, is lost and adrift in both the multicultural centres of Toronto, and Oakville, one of the WASPiest communities in Ontario.  His marriage has failed, he's lost his job, and he doesn't really know who he is.  Langston decides to study his family history, and through the lives of four other Langston Canes, a variety of perspectives on black history and culture in Canada and the United States come to light.  In the meantime, Langston himself learns what it means to be of mixed race, at once neither black or white, and both.  An intelligent look at racial and historical issues, this book is also a well-written, wonderfully entertaining set of stories-within-a-story.I enjoyed this book so much, I headed out to the library to find Hill's first novel, Some Great Thing, another fabulous, yet underpublicized book.  If possible, I liked it even better.
