Once again Alister MacLean has woven a story that kept me riveted to my chair.  I could not put the book down until I had read it through.  MacLean was an extremely good story teller and he managed to do this without the use of sex and foul language.  Quite a feat in this world today.  Be warned though, if you haven't the time to read a book from cover to cover in a sitting, then do not pick this one up.  It is truly riveting.
