I've always been a huge Agatha Christie fan, but this book is a complete departure from her usual work and I hate to say it, but it falls short. I always finish reading a book if I start it, but there were times when I was really tempted to just put this one down. If you're looking for classic Christie, this is probably not the book for you. I found the beginning quite good, but ended up plodding through the rest of it.
