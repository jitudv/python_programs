As much as I loved A Game of Thrones, liked A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords, I disliked this book  Also hated A Feast for Crows.  Self-indulgent, wandering purple prose going nowhere, a total waste of time.  If you're hoping for some resolution for the characters you've grown to love and hate, forget it.  They are all just left in limbo.  Martin should have stopped while he was ahead because this definitely left a bad taste, a feeling he just spewed it out to make some more money.
