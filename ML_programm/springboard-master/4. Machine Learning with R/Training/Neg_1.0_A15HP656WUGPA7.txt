Spoiler alert....and descriptions of graphic bodily functions etc. I give it one star, as a grace...compared to his other books in this series. But as a stand alone book...it doesn't deserve one star at all. ZERO for me.We purchased this book because both my hubby and I enjoyed the series so far.  I personally did not like Book 4, however.It has taken me almost 4 months to finish this volume.  Why?  Because it is so God awfully MORBID!  GAD...one would need psychiatric counseling or antidepressants at least to enjoy this book. So I trudged along at about 20 pgs a night...put it aside...tried again and again. Hubby kept saying...stick with it... it gets "better". Well it doesn't.  Some chapters, actually seem like the older volumes. Then the slag begins again. Boring, endless new dead end characters, pus, gore, stink, monkeys throwing feces, vomiting, blood, burning, eyeballs exuding liquids (poor Prince Martell). Poor Dany... she is vomiting like the rest of them!I have reached my maximum ability to tolerate "realism" where Martin is concerned.  Does every page, every chapter have to have gruesome, endlessly detailed morbid descriptions of body functions, injuries, behaviors, murders?We purchased this book on Amazon...and sent it to our vacation destination. What a huge mistake. Don't read this book if you are looking to relax, or have a good time. It will drag you down, and poison your days and possibly your dreams.I can't see any of this book on movie or TV media.  How would it translate?  Good Grief!I do think RR Martin is a talented writer (from his earlier books). But this stuff?  NOPE....it is just sensationalism and depressing.
