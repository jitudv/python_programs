Martin continues his tradition of dragging out plotlines to the point where you want to skip whole chapters to find something significant happening.  His writing skills are excellent, but I've finally realized I don't care for his storytelling.  With so many point-of-view characters it's no wonder that his books crawl.  I have come to believe that he keeps adding characters simply because he runs out of people to kill.I was so disappointed in the ending, after taking so much effort to finish the book, that is the last of his novels I will read.  I am clearing the others out of my library.Read at your own risk and don't expect much in the way of a conclusion.  Then again, that's the way all of Martin's books are so I'm sure you know this already.
