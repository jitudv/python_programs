Many many reviews have been posted, and I will attempt not to repeat what has been said already.I cannot comprehend the positive reviews of this trash.  I am a lover of quality historical novels - Sharon Kay Penman and Jean Plaidy are mentioned by other reviewers ... Phillippa Gregory is in no way comparable.  The Other Boleyn Girl is historical only in that it purports to take place a long time ago.Mary Boleyn is potrayed as THIRTEEN years old when she is engaging in witty repartee with king far too old and worldly to be legitimately interested in what she had to say.  Indeed, in our world, Henry would have landed on a Nightline special.  Well, we know what HE was interested in, but why would we, the reading public, want to read a novel romanticizing behavior which we claim to believe is criminal?And for some readon Gregory has chosen to distort history and represent Mary Boleyn as even younger than she probably was, and far more innocent.  If we wonder why teenagers go on-line to flirt with and meet unknown older men, we need only look at is considered entertaining in a novel.The character of Anne is no more credible ... the author wold have us believe that powerful families intent on pimping a child to the king would listen to a 15-16 year old girls's advice on how to accomplish its plan.Overall, the characters are more Sex and the City (I can see Samantha as Anne)than history.  I read this nonsense for far longer than I should have, waiting for improvement.  Then I gave up. Now I am stuck with this book as well as the sequel (which I have no intention of reading).  Both are destined for Half Price Books.
