I picked up the first book and loved it.  The second book was okay...but didn't have a purpose beyond expanding the story...then we got into books three to five.  Great stories...but no reason for them...new characters coming out of the wood work and not advancing the plot.  This last book was hopelessly the worse one yet...nothing happened and the characters never got beyond doing stuff...To be honest George R.R. Martin is a great writer and should stick to short stories, or he needs to go back to writing 101 and learn to develop a novel...or just go back to book one...he did so much better there.
