I read this book mostly when I was in waiting rooms or similar circumstances.  Since I would only read 5-10 pages a week, it took over a year and a half to finish.  In spite of that, the book was a marvel.  The characters were so well drawn, the story was so involving that I had no difficulty in picking up the thread even if a month when by between reads.
