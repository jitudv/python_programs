This is really a classic fantasy trilogy?  This is really the guy who wrote Tigana, A Song for Arbonne, and The Lions of Al Rassan?  I must be missing something.  I know that millions of people should  not be able to be this wrong, but in this case they most certainly are.This is probably one of the worst fantasy novels I have ever read.  Nothing that happens seems to be natural, but happens because the author wants it to happen.  No characters seem to be alive, but only exist because the author needs them to exist.  The conversations are stilted and dull.  Nothing works in this novel.In the reviews, there seems to be a consensus that things get better later in the series, but I say so what?  This book stinks and the fact is there are better starts to better series.  The sad thing is that I was / am a big Kay fan.If you like the standard, derivative, sub par, fantasy, then eat your heart out.  If you are like me and read Tigana, read the Lions of Al Rassan, A Song for Arbonne, read the Sarantine Mosaic, heard that Kay's first work was a trilogy and got real excited to see what he could do with traditional fantasy, then do not bother.  Trust me, you will be very disappointed.
