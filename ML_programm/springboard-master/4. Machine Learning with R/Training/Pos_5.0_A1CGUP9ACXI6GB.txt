My husband read these and loved them. I picked up the first one and read a chapter or two and set it down. Now that I have a Kindle it is hard to read 'real' books. It isn't really my genre anyway. Then the series came out on TV and I was hooked and read them all. I will say had struggled a bit with all of the people to keep track of and I'm not certain his transitions are as good as they could be. My suggestion to him would be that if you have that many character and story lines that adding some clues would help along with better transitions. I suspect that the editor has his hands tied and isn't allowed the full capacity of his job.So it is hard to say whether I just didn't want to read the book the first time or the author didn't visualize them enough for me so keep that in mind while deciding to consider my rating. There were moments when I passed the series and had to go back a bit or rework things. If I had one thing to say to George RR Martin is, don't change your mind. If it happened in the book and you second guess yourself and wish you'd done something else, let it go and stick with the book. Makes it a bit confusing.
