The first book in this series, the actual 'Game of Thrones', was incredibly interesting. It was a whole new world, with complex and well-developed characters. It was a world of wonder, of legend and of horror. Game of Thrones got me from its first page.Then came the second book. And I thought... Meh.Then the third book. MEH.The fourth book. "Oh Lord, I hope the fifth is better than this ****!".And the fifth book...A Dance with Dragons is one of the worst books I have EVER read in my life. More than a thousand pages long, and NOTHING happens. I really don't know what Martin was thinking when he decided to write this book.Okay, after the first book we already had clues that the series was not going anywhere, but one couldn't help but hope that such an incredible writer would be able to produce something good after so much time.Guess what? This book can't deliver.In fact, when I say that NOTHING HAPPENS in this book, I really mean it. The characters just wander around, CLEARLY filling pages. I don't know why would any editor publish this kind of work.I am probably not the only one, but I SHALL NOT buy the other two books, if they ever get released. This is simply one of the worst written works I've had the misfortune to read.Take this from a former fan: don't waste your money on this.
