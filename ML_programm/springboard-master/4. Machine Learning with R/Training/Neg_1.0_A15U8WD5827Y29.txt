I loved the first 3 books, and got through each in about a week.  The 4th was not as good for reasons folks have already mentioned, but it still was readable despite some of my favorite characters being saved for book 5.After almost 1 month, I am only 1/3 through the book and despair of finishing it.  I have skipped some chunks that were most tedious, but even the chapters where my favorite characters (those few that have not been killed off or MIA), the story is not compelling.I guess these last 2 books are bridges for the next one, but good luck getting through this one.Maybe he is distracted by the HBO series, or HBO is influencing the story, but I fear I will have to put this book to rest after one last attempt.
