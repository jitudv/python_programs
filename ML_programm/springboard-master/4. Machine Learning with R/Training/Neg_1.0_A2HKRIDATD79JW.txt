Not much happens in this book.  The one before it I probably read 200 pages as I skimmed through, for this one it was probably closer to 50.  There just wasn't anything worth stopping for as I skipped around in this empy ghost-town of a book.On a more constructive note: The Name of the Wind, and The Wise Man's Fear are still great books you might enjoy instead.
