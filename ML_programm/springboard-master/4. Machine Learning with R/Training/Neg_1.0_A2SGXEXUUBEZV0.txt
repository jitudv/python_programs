You will probably come to books 4 and 5 of A Song Of Fire And Ice expecting the books as good as Books 1 and 3. Or at least Book 2 (nobody expects much from "bridge" books so I don't think many were offended by #2). Won't you be disappointed.Frank Zappa had a fun term in the 60's and 70's for albums that were obviously inferior to the band's previous work, cranked out just to get the record company off the artist's back; he called it a "contractual obligation" album. Books 4 and 5 are almost the opposite and Book 5 should never have been written. The whole thing should have been wrapped up in Book 4. I gave this book one less star than Book 4 because of the way it tortured me.But the author succumbed to the lure of HBO money and so he strung out the series while lacking interesting material or story line, subjecting his readers to the worst sort of affliction any author can: boredom. Seriously, I felt like I was being punished by the end of the first third of Book 5. I had a heck of a time getting through the entire series (to date). Could 1800 or so pages (I have a Kindle so it's difficult to tell exactly) feel more like slow death? MY slow death?I guess Martin decided that replacing interesting story with sex was an acceptable strategy to fill the pages. This ramps up in each book after Book 1 as he runs lower on ideas. Let me tell you, it works as well in book form as it does in poorly written movies; sex and swearing takes the place of good plot and character development perfectly, doesn't it? That must be why movie attendance is continually dropping, the strategy DOESN'T work. At all. I'll bet a lot of viewers drop out during Season 4 and the series may be cancelled by Season 5.If you've read Books 1-3 just wait and go straight to Book 6. I guarantee you won't have missed much.
