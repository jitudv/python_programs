I like Tom Clancy's books, but I thought the whole premise to this one was just silly.  There were too many contradictions in the story for it or the characters to be believable.  The hero is an ex special forces guy, trying to help a new girlfriend face her past demons and bring evil men (murderers) to justice.  Instead of heading straight for the cops he decides to joy ride in her old neighborhood where she is recognized and immediately becomes a target.  (I know when I am trying to protect someone I love from harm I always drive down to the projects.)  They are chased and shot at but manage to escape.  But instead of immediately heading to safety at the police station (still their destination), they park in a secluded area and decide to wait there until their cop buddy comes on duty, and then drive to see him.  Well the bad guys never quit looking, and sneak up on the parked couple. Mr Tough Guy gets caught by surprise and his girl dies. In the hospital, he vows revenge because he is such a tough guy (his nickname was even Snake, he's such a bad mother-f***).  Sure.  He's such a badass that he brought his love into a dangerous neighborhood, let them get ambushed and got her killed.  Watch out everybody!  Here comes the Homer Simpson of the vengeance league.
