It is entirely possible that Martin either did NOT write the first 3 books or did not write the last 2 books...the notion that the same person wrote all 5 is impossible.  We could henpeck all the inconsistencies in style and tone and talent, but there's really no point. If you're a fan, you know something's wrong.I've read other stuff by Martin and it's pretty decent. Fever Dream being on of my favorite vampire books, I'd say the guy has some talent in writing. That said, NONE of his other books come close the the complexity and moxie of SOIAF.  I have theories as to why the first three books are not in the same league as the last two.
