This was all plots and plans and no action. While it might have pictured what life was actually like in the Boleyn/Howard family, there was no action to it -- and I know that "plots and plans" can actually make a decent book, because "Memoirs of a Geisha" proves it!Thankfully, I didn't buy this book alone (I bought it at the same time I bought "The Queen's Fool"), or I would've discounted Ms. Gregory as a truly boring author altogether. Hopefully, this book was just a fluke and her others (like "The Constant Princess" and "The Virgin's Lover") are just as good as "The Queen's Fool".
