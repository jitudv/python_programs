Not a page turns without a member of the British commando unit making a quip. The humor is so dense that even one of the characters remarks on it! And the military behavior of the British commando unit, specifically the behavior of the unit's leader, Major Smith, is so laughable that it boggles the mind. In one passage Major Smith (played by Richard Burton in the movie) remembers that he tied up a German radio operator in a room just above the room he has set on fire to cause a diversion. Well, even with Alpenkorps soldiers just yards away searching for the British, and the whole fate of the mission in great jeopardy, Major Smith, even to the consternation of Lieutenant Schaffer (played by Clint Eastwood in the movie), runs back up to the room where the tied up German radio operator is and unties him! It would seem that the World War II Alistair MacLean wants to impart to us was a kinder, gentler World War II where chivalry still ruled military conduct; IT DID NOT, ON EITHER SIDE OF THE CONFLICT!Another thing that annoyed me was the disrespectful way in which Lieutenant Schaffer refers to Major Smith, his superior, throughout the novel: 'boss'. However, the character of Lieutenant Schaffer can be excused for such insubordination since MacLean, unintentionally, gives us a character devoid of any intellectual rigor, to put it kindly. Particularly squeamish is Lieutenant Schaffer's imbecilic spur of the moment decision to marry and spend the rest of his life with a British agent he's just met in Germany!The screenplay for the movie, also written by Alistair MacLean, is by contrast a far superior product. MacLean excises from the movie all of the ludicrous quips and the equally ludicrous military blunders committed by the British commandos that are found in the novel.Avoid the novel at all costs! Watch the movie instead!
