I used to love to read, however it has been ages since a book has captured me like this one did. The description of characters is both dear and terrible at times.  The description of the life with the circus in this time in history is fascinating. Not really for young readers, it is a bit lusty in some areas but not offensive to me. I have not experienced the movie yet, it will be a challenge to capture the quality of this  book.  I look forward to reading more of Sara Gruen novels.
