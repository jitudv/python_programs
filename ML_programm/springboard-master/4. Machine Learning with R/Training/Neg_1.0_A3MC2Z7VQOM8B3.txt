I hate not finishing a book that I've started, but in the case of this incredibly long, drawn-out, and boring novel, I had no qualms whatsoever. The characters are as unsympathetic as they come, with the 2-D Maria who has probably never entertained a thought in her head, she is so stupid and empty, except to please Robert Jordan, who spends hundreds and hundreds of pages just thinking random thoughts, and walking from place to place. I thought that Anna Karenina was long and drawn out, but even at 800 + pages that book was less drawn out than this wprthless piece. It was completely unnecessary for it to be so long--one of Hemingway's short stories, about an old man on a bridge during the spanish civil war, at less than 3 pages is ten times more movign and poignant than this book. And it doesn't even really paint the Spanish civil war all that well--if you really want a glimpse of what it was like, go rent and watch the classic movie "La lengua de los mariposas" or "Butterfly" in English, which will give you a better idea and much mroe enjoyment at the same time. This book also isn't really that action-packed at all for a war book--I'd say fighting and battle takes up maybe two-fifths fo the book at the most, it's mostly just talking, long stories, long ten page thought streams of RJ, or just walking from place to place, describing things with some of the longest run-on sentences I've ever seen (anyone who tells you that Hemingway's style was just short and simple sentences is full of it in regard to this book).In short, this book is not worth your time--read one of Hemingway's short stories if you must, but not this long, drawn out, boring yarn.
