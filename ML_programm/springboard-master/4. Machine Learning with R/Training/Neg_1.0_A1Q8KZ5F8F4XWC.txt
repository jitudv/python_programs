Let me say I think GRRM has a great sense of character and can do a plot twist like nobody's business.That said, does he know how to wrap up ANY storyline without a death to the main character in that storyline?  We've invested hours and pages in characters and plotlines, only to have brand new characters introduced...AGAIN... and a character we are invested in killed off because GRRM doesn't know what else to do with them.I was hoping to find Dance With Dragons have more focus and development on Jon, Arya, Bran and their wolves, Tyrion, Cersie, Jamie, and Dany and Sam.  Was I disappointed?  In the end - yes, big time.  (possible spoiler ahead)I got a lot of back & forth with Dany and Meeren and almost no development of her relationship with the dragons or who else may ride them.I got bits of Arya's growth, but not much and only toward the end of the book.Bran - a few chapters of odd situations that seemed like filler and a way to put him aside.Jon got chapters about his dealings with Wildings and Stannis, but not the Others or Ghost.Cersie - chapters toward the end of the book ending in her being marginalized and set aside.Jamie - one chapter only!Sam - nothingTyrion - Hurray!  Some interesting bits of intrigue but not what I was hoping for.New people - lots and lots and I didn't care about any of them at all.I loved books 1 & 2 and they got me hooked on this series.  Book 3 was annoying at times, but I stuck with it.  Book 4 was a dissappointment because of the new characters, but I gave it a chance & held out hope for this book.  That said, I will not recomment this book or series to anyone and I doubt I'll read anything else in the series in the future.  GRRM is a good writer, too bad he cannot end a story.  Maybe a new editor would help, but I doubt it.
