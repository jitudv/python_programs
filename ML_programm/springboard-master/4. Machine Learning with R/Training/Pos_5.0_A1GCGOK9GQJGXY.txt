Recommend to all who loves history & romance - not too much of history, not too much of romance, but really an emotional page-turner! I was totally obsessed with it and bought all other books of this series. My biggest surprise was to see the film with the same title - nothing to do with the book and everything totally rotten, cause and reason interchanged etc.
