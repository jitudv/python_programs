I enjoyed reading this book - it was hard to put down. It is a lovely love story with several twists and turns.  I loved how it showed the emotions of the elephant, which made me fall in love with her even more.  It reminded me a lot of the &#34;Notebook&#34;, going from present time to past through the main character's memory.  This is definately a must read for the romantic at heart.
