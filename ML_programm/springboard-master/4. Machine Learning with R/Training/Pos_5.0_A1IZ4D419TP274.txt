One of the things I really liked is that the author, George R R Martin, puts an incredible amount of detail into each character so you feel you actually know them.  Some you will love and some not but just when you think you know what's going to happen next there's a twist throw in.  Really keeps you going.  My only problem with this book is that book six isn't written yet!  Oh what a let down.
