This book was absolutely terrible.  I had seen some Clancy movies and thought I would enjoy one of his books.  Boy was I wrong.  I'll never read another again.  The characters were so one dimensional.  The &quot;hero&quot; was, in my opinion, a cold-blooded killer who was as bad as the &quot;psychopaths&quot; he was out to get.  He actually tortured one of the bad guys to death.  It was also apparent that he couldn't be without a woman.  During the six months between the time his beloved wife died and he met his new love, he &quot;visited&quot; hookers twice.  He then fell in love (in a matter of hours) with a hitchhiker he picked up.  Within a week after she was gone, he glommed on to the nurse who treated his wounds in the hospital.  Everyone in the book was either all black or all white.  I don't have one good thing to say about this book.  Hard to believe this author actually made money from this junk.
