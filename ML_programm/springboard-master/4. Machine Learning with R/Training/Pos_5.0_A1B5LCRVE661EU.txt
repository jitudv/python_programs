I'm a HUGE fan of this series and have loved racing through all the intrigue and excitement of life in Martin's worlds.  This book seemed much shorter than some others; so I was disappointed to be finished so quickly!  I love the story line with all its upsets and victories, its characters and their foibles and strengths, and the way villains sometimes become my heroes! I am eagerly, if a bit impatiently, awaiting the next installment!
