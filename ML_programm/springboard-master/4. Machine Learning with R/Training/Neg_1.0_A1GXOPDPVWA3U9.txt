I have to preface by saying I loved book 1 but have been increasingly disappointed with subsequent novels. (OK maybe book 3 was reasonable). It is sad to see a series where each book is about half as good as the one before it. Martin needs an editor with an iron fist. This book makes watching grass grow exciting. Really, why take every character that you have built over many books and either degrade them, make them unpleasant and unlikable, or just slit their throat. And while you are at it, throw in some brand new characters who meander around contributing nothing to the overarching storyline.I so enjoyed the first book. I survived the death of so many main characters in the next few books. But now, I just can't be bothered anymore. The whole series should have stayed a trilogy. I can't make the effort to wade through chapters of nothing to get the odd tidbit of plot progression.Can someone tell me after they finish the series if anyone worth caring for survives? Do the dragons come and melt the icy bad guys? Does Tyrion get to be King? Do I really care?
