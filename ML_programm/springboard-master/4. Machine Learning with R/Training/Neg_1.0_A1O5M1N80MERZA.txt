1000 pages of endless dithering.  Dany has three dragons but can't bring herself to work with them.  Too many different characters doing different things with little story cohesion.  Just when a chapter actually gets going it ends and you are back to food descriptions, sailing, marching, back story...There is little development of Bran and Arya, both were fascinating possibilities but he just teased us with them.And not an Other in sightAnd the end?  Was the worst part. Made me angry. No more of my money  will I spend Mr Martin has lst his way. Good stories have a beginning a middle and an end.  He is just milking us now like Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan.
