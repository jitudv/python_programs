This book was a disappointing read. I found it to be historically inaccurate- The Duke of Buckingham was not a close relative to the Boleyns, Mary spent time in The French Court and was a minor mistress to Francis I. She married Carey while she was Henry's mistress. Anne was the younger sister, but was not fifteen when she came to the English court; she was probably closer to 20 and was a maid of honor tho Henry's siter Mary, the Dowager Queen of France. It's almost like reading the People or Us version of Tudor history. I've tried to read a few of Ms. Gregory's novels and I have not enjoyed them. If you want a good read about Anne Boleyn, read Eric Ives'wonderful biography or some of Alison Weir's works.(Even though she is not very sympathetic to Anne.) The truth is much more interesting than the fiction.
