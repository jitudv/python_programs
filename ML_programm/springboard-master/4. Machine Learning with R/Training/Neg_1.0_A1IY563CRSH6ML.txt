I'm another reader who can't even begin to understand why this book was so popular, or why people rave about Gruen's writing.  I thought the writing was mediocre at best, and that the plot, narration, and dialogue were BORING!  Plus, the characters aren't very likable, and the frequent graphic sex scenes are completely unnecessary.  I tried to like this book, and I tried to finish it, but I really couldn't, on either count.
