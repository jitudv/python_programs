I just finished this book and I must ay that it was a spectacularly boring  collection inane sentences.It starts off ambitiously enough, written in  a general and uniquely abstract style, it lets you know from the get go  that its first-person, narrator-unreliable. Good enough, always nice to see  new forms of writing in the field. Then, however, it plummets.Like many  inept Brit science fiction writers, the author attempts to turn everyday  optical illusions and quirky perceptions into witty existential-scientific  theories, and abstract social theories into reality, without any  interpretation. I guess because Douglas Adams pulled it off in Hitchhiker's  guide, book editors now let any hack from across the pond try it.  Unfortunately, as is usual, it failed. Instead of thgought provoking,  amusing prose on things we never think about, we are weighed down with  boring chaotic nonsense. Only Forward shows all the brilliance of a  shorted-out low watt bulb, covered in mud.The plot is choppy and lacks  any coherent purpose, the characters are dull, one dimensional, and devoid  of interest.  In this reader's opinion: the description on the back of the  book is a heck of a lot more interesting than the book itself. Maybe next  time the author will try writing that instead of the disjointed nonsense he  slopped inside.
