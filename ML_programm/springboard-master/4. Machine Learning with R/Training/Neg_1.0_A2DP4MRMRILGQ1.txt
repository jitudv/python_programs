I've just been notified by Amazon that the paperback release date for this book has been pushed back AGAIN, this time until September of 2014.  Absolutely ridiculous that it will take at least three and a half years to get a paperback to market, and for people who like their series to be in the same format, a hard cover is not an option.  Order cancelled.
