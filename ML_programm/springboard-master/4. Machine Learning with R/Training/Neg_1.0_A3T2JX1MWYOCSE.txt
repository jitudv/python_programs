Now, I do not mind some artistic freedom, I.E. condensing the time frame, adding new characters and events as long as the truth remains intact. Not so here and as a modern woman it SICKENS me to see a nobody like Mary Boleyn who, during her time, was known as a slut and stupid, easy tramp, being elevated to be innocent heroine while a a fascinating, brilliant woman like Anne Boleyn is turned into a tasteless, swearing, slutty bitch. Where is Anne's wit, her elegance, her charm and her lively humor? Hasn't poor Anne been maligned enough? And this author even believes that she committed incest and adultery, something that NO historian worth his money would agree with? Warnicke, the historian Gregory based some of her theories on, frigging distanced herself from this drivel, what does that tell you?Another thing that BUGGED me senseless: The portrayal of Henry as a pedophile, screwing 13 year old Mary Boleyn. YUCK.Badly researched, distorted, perverted and sickening drivel posing a literature. And of course this pile of rotten garbage will be a huge movie next year, trash always secures profit while the truth may not be "interesting" enough. It took centuries to clear at least most of Anne's reputation from all the filth thrown at her by ignorant fools. Now all that work will be rendered useless by this awful book and the upcoming film. BRAVO, Miss Gregory, I hope you're happy! Absolutely revolting and disgusting!
