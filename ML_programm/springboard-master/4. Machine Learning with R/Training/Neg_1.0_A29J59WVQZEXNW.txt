I just wanted to add my one star review because this book doesn't deserve its three star rating. My wife was disgusted by the torture porn, and I was as well, not because I'm a prude but because it was too graphic and totally unnecessary. It didn't add to the story at all.GRRM has taken a page out of Robert Jordan's craft and is now turning his fans against him with endless discussion of food, finery, unnecessary descriptions of things that don't matter and pissing off the end of things.I quit the book after 200 pages, my wife quit after 150. Like others, we loved the first three books and the last two have been painful.How GRRM can repeat the mistake Robert Jordan made is beyond me.
