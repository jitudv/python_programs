Bought this in paper...sorry I did. A five year wait for this? I was reminded of one of those half-azzed Star Trek movies they did just to keep the series going. Even soap operas kill off people and end storylines. This book could have been okay if he'd had the balls to complete some threads and not just worried about the next payday. We aren't all morons out here, George.
