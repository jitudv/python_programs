this little book has pictures with ideas for garnishments; not just syrup and butter.  I am one who is inspired by the pictures; I won't by a cookbook without it and looking at the pictures in this book makes you want to start cooking!  The first recipe I tried turned out great tasting  too, plus no hard to find ingredients.
