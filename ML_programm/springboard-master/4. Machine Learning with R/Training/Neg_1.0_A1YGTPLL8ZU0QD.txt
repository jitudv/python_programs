Sorry to all those people that seemingly loved this book, but i am afraid that i found it just woeful.  It was the sort of book that gives fantasy a bad name.  Indeed it is so inferior to such "B" grade fantasy as the Belgariad series that it would need a catergory all of its own.  As so many other reviewers have said it is an amalgam, a "hash" of Tolkien, Narnia, Arthurian myths and a myriad of other borrowed themes.  Surprisingly, upon acknowledgement of these borrowings, most reviewers go on to say this it was still a fine book?  The characterisation was stereotypical and superficial with little or no exploration of the potential for culture shock that C21st americans might experience in what would be their technological equivalent of a third world country.  There is so little to recommend this book that i am truly surprised that it has such a strong following.
