I began to feel about halfway through the third book that this series had gotten away from GRRM - he'd killed off most of the interesting and sympathetic characters and didn't know what to do with the ones who were left. The fourth book was bad and this one is just terrible. A boring, painful slog through a meandering plot, endless details, and tangential stories about random characters, most of whom are either new to the book or so un-memorable they might as well be. I'm imagining our author laughing hysterically about having written as bad a book as he could and still selling it. That's the only explanation I can come up with.
