When George started killing characters that I loved, I bit the bullet and plowed on, thinking that it would be all right in the end, that some of them would prevail and "win" if you will, but it seems as if he knows no other plot twist than to kill off many of the characters and then maybe bring them back with the "magic" we were told was not that prevalent in this world. Martin has "lost the plot", quite literally.  He has lost control of his characters and the narrative and knows no way to contritely wrap up a storyline. The story goes nowhere in book five and a character that I have been rooting for since book one may have been killed off, making all of his efforts wasted, if this is so, it is a disgrace, but even more so if he is brought back by some mystical rite. I have lost all faith in this series, add another one-star to the pile.
