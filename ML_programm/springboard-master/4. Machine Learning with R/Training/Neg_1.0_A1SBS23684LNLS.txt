Would've been an appropriate title.I am so disgusted with myself for the amount of time I wasted reading this book. I can't even imagine how disgusted George Martin must be with himself for the amount of time he wasted writing it.Jon Snow dead? Who knows, who cares any more. I'm finished with this series. Mr. Martin, do us a favor and stop writing - it's unbearable.
