I started reading the series after watching the first year of Game of Thrones on HBO. The books were as exciting as the series. I had purchased the four book package and when I finished it, there were too many gaps left open with no path for the reader to follow. Mr. Martin explained that there is a book 5 coming that is actually a parallel to book 4, as there was too much information to be presented.I definitely agreed that there were way too many holes and characters that you care about left hanging at the end. So, I looked forward to book 5, A Dance with Dragons.I have to say it was one of the worst endings to anything I have ever read. It was like " I have to finish this, but don't know where to take it. Let's just kill off everyone and throw in more people!". Except all the new characters are so disgusting you can't wait for the book to end. Characters that were so important to this series are dead and others that book 4 indicated were killed, seem to walk off happily together in book 5.I did see in the HBO Series, some movement in the second season that deviated from book 2. If there is any hope left, the producers will save Game of Thrones. If they stay on the path of the books, I fear all is lost. Maybe that is what Mr. Martin is trying to convey.
