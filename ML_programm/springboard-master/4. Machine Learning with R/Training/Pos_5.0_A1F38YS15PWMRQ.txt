Here, Patterson shows us what really made him famous. His first several books were really stunning thrillers, up to and including Cat And Mouse. but since then all his Alex Cross books have just been re-hashings of the same old plots.This book is great. It's a chilling read, with an excellent and truly original plot. Alex Cross comes across as a great compassionate character, who has much life in him. But Unfortunately, patterson tired him out very quickly.With this book Patterson created one of his most chilling victims. He is chilling because Patterson spends time making him so. Developing his character. With his latest books, Patterson doesn't bother developing his villains )or ANY of his characters, for that matter) and just expects us to believe him when he says they are "a chilling and terrifying killer" and leaves it at that. With this book, he really shwos us what he can do. He is listening to his fans to much when they say "can't you write faster". He has chosen to do so, and in doing that has sacrificed good characters and original plots.This book was a great pageturner and a great thriller, with a really brilliant and unexpected twist right at the end. I cannot reccomend this highly enough. How i wish patterson had stayed with this kind of book, rather than started attending the Danielle Steel school of literature. (i.e. it doesn't matter about the quality, the more the write, the more you sell, so let's laugh all the way to the bank) A once great author. I hope he soon refinds his previous great form which he displayed here.
