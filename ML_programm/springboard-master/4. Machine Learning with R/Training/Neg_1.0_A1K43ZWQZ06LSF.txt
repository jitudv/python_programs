If this were the first Lisa Scottoline book I had ever read I would not read any others.  I don't remember ever hearing the word "ridiculous" scream in my head when reading her other books, but I sure did this time.  From the implausible premise that defense attorneys would be incensed to learn that their client is actually guilty (horrers!) to the lengths said attorneys would then go to prove him guilty including breaking the law this story is ridiculous.
