I'll make this as short as possible...........like I wish the book would have been.  This read was easily twice as long as it needed to be.  I got halfway through, and quit.  It was so boring.  I wanted, (as always), a good story, not a tedious dialog that goes on and on about every little detail involved in colonizing a planet.  I can't believe this author is receiving accolades for this work.  He can, in no way, be compared to any of the greats in the sci-fi field.
