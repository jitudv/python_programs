Water For Elephants is the story of ninety-something nursing home resident Jacob Jankowski, who reflects on the time he spent with the Benzini Brothers circus when he was in his early 20's during the Depression Era.  The story goes back and forth between those two periods of Jacob's life.  Old Jacob is clearly frustrated by the physical limitations of his aged body, and how small his world has become while living in the nursing home.  Young Jacob joins the circus due to circumstances in his home life that are beyond his control, and the story goes on to describe the events that occurred during the time that Jacob spent with the circus as the staff veterinarian.Sara Gruen writes with such rich detail.  The sights, sounds and images she portrays are all so vivid that while reading this, I felt that I was transported to another time and place.  I learned so much about what circus life was like during the 1930's, and how disposable both human and animal life were to the circus owners.  I was also very interested to learn that many of the happenings in the book are actually based on real-life events.  The characterizations of the animals were particularly well-written in this book, too.This book truly exceeded my expectations, and I am anxiously awaiting the release of the film!
