I am completely convinced that the author of A Dance with Dragons is not the same person who wrote A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords.  Here's my reasoning.  Take the book A Storm of Swords.  Open it to any page.  Now open A Dance with Dragons to the same page number.  Read the page in A Storm of Swords and immediately read the page of A Dance with Dragons.  Repeat this process three of four times.  A simliar comparison of A Dance with Dragons to A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings is worth the effort.Compare the use of dialog, narrative, and even punctuation.  The difference is amazing isn't it.  Most reviews are complaining that A Dance with Dragons is a poor companion to the first three books in the series based on plot and lack of forward momentum, but no one is addressing the reason behind the slip in quality. My take is that the difference in the very mechanics of writing between A Dance with Dragons and the first three books is so dramatic the it could not possibly be written by the same author.So who wrote A Dance with Dragons?  If it was truly George R. R. Martin, then who wrote the first three books?  It just can't be the same guy.
