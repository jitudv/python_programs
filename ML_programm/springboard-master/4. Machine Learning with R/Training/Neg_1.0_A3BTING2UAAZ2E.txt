I hunkered down and read Dance with Dragons having read the previous four in the series.  Ended up skimming the whole thing and even that was a waste of my time.  All the really good characters are left unresolved for the most part.  Dumbest thing ever.  Really, really, really frustrating and disappointing. I can't recall being so completely disgusted with a book and an author.
