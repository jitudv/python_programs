Instead I recommend Fraser's*The Complete McAuslan*The Pyrates: A Swashbuckling Comic Novel*Quartered Safe Out Here: A Harrowing Tale of WWIIMr. American and Flashman (#1) are listless. It's hard to believe that the same man wrote these books.My next Fraser will be 'The Reavers', a comic novel of the Border Reivers, loosely based on the Candlemass Road, in the style of his earlier novel The Pyrates.And The 'Light's on at Signpost', a memoir of the author's days writing in Hollywood, interspersed with criticism of political correctness and New Labour.
