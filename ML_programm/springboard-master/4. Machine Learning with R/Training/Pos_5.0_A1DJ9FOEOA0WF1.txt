I enjoy virtually following Ms Goodall into the forests and learning about the actions of the species she continues to study. How wonderful--for her and us--for her to have learned so early in her life just which species she wanted to study. Her contributions to the study of primates in their natural habitat continues, and her explanations of such are a joy to read. Highly recommended.
