Water for Elephants was a fabulous book.  I could not put it down.  The photos of Circus life back in the 30's added to the experience.  You won't be disappointed with this book as it contained lots of action, great characters, and a wonderful love story between a young man and woman and their love of the circus animals.Water for Elephants: A Novel
