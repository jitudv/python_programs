It is very rare that I don't finish a book. I just couldn't find a single reason to continue reading; the writing style is that of a children's book - in a strange combination with graphic sex and 21st century profanity (both of which I don't mind in the right setting), the language doesn't match the 30ies, the cruelty to animals made me cringe, and the story was predictable.
