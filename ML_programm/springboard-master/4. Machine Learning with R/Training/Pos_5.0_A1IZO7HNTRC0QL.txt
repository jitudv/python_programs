Of hundreds of cookbooks that claim to include Mexican dishes, this is the only one that completely holds to original, regional, and traditional dishes, without adding any modern variations. It has endured in my kitchen for 40 years, and remains as the singular reliable reference for Mexican recipes. The photography is excellent, and it is only too bad that it is no longer in publication. I have bought them as presents for one or two very special "cocineras".
