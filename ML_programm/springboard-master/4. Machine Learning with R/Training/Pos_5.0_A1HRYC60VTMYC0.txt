Jacob's life takes a drastic turn when his parents die. Stripped of everything he owns, everything familiar to him, all the comforts of his college and family life that he took for granted, he leaves his old life behind, jumps a train that turns out to be a circus train, and enters a totally new, different world. A circus is fun, right? Not behind the scenes, in this book. Jacob, a young adult, naive, still a virgin, unused to such a hard life on the road, confronts danger, murder, hatred, love, callous human viciousness, more danger, and finds friends and allies (not all of them human) in the unlikeliest of places.The story is told in turn, by the nonogenarian Jacob now in a nursing home, and at other times, by the twenty-something Jacob working at the circus and trying not to get killed -- mostly at the hands of his fellow-human-associates. Every chapter is an adventure, held my attention and took turns gladdening, saddening and surprising me.The circus animals also get into the act in this book and the author's sensitive rendering and treatment of them makes them all the more vivid, as "supporting actors",  Circus "employees", and fellow participants in the intrigue and action.A masterful ending -- leaving the reader with hope, glee and wonder. The very informative afterword by the author left me wanting to do my own research into this fascinating subject of the Circus.
