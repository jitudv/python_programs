Not even close.  I bought the series based on the Nebula and Hugo Awards.  What a HUGE mistake....and I will never trust those particular award juries again.  This guy does not have much to say, but says it repeatedly, exhaustively, and ad nauseum.  The characters are exclusively two dimensional, all lacking passion and driven by inexplicable logic to actions that make little sense.  The extensive descriptive narrative is mind numbing and filled with geological jargon.  You spend most of the book wading through this blah blah blah, and when something finally does happen, it is disappointinly anti-climactic.  I will never buy another piece of literature by this author.
