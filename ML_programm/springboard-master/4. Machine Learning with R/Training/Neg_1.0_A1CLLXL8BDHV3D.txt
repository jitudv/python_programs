Too many characters to keep track of after waiting entirely too long for the 5th book. The book beat to death unrelated characters and bogged down in its mirco plots.  The book was chopped to pieces. Maybe Martin will be able to bring it all together, but I doubt I'll live long enough to see that happen, what with his world book signing tours and missed deadlines. Will I buy his next book? NOPE! I'm done with Martin. I paid my money for the book and I was feel I was cheated.
