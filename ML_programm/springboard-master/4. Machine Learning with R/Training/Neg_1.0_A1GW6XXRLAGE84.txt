I don't believe the story will ever be finished and I don't believe any additional books will recapture what made the series so addictive in Books 1 - 3.I sincerely hope that HBO cuts ties with the book after season 3 the way they did with the Sookie Stackhouse books OR that Martin gives up all together and lets talented ghost writers take the wheel.I'm kind of glad that the next book probably won't be out for six years because it will probably take that long for me to get over my bitterness over the weeks I wasted reading Books 4 and 5.
