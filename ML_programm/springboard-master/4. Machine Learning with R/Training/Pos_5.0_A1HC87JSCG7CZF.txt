Gruen has all the elements for a terrific novel - the circus, the Depression, a love triangle, a bitter old widower reflecting on his life ... but ultimately this is nothing more than a mediocre summer distraction for those of us who really don't like to read.I wouldn't write a review if not for the fact I was so let down by its strong premise. Other than the fact this quickly becomes a cheesy romance after promising so much more, I couldn't get passed thinking that one of the main characters, August, was trying to be Nathan from Sophie's Choice.Another problem was Jacob, the novel's main character and narrator. The problem I have is that despite the name - Jacob - and despite the fact he's in love with a beautiful woman, and despite the fact that - I don't know - he urinates standing up, the main character really is a woman who the writer calls a man. This is a problem I have with a lot of male writers when they write women (Wally Lamb is a rare exception). Jacob's behavior, thoughts, actions, words, everything, are those of a female character. So when Jacob and Marlena finally get together, well...If you're sitting by the pool or at the beach and there's nothing else to do or read, go ahead and read this one. It's not a terrible novel, just a disappointing one.
