As I write this the Space Shuttle just launched after being delayed for a month with technical glitches - this in 2009. It's still a "hold your breath" event whenever that marvel of space technology takes to the sky. After two tragic crashes, no one can take for granted that the shuttle will go and return safely.Why then does the author think that in the year of 2026, a mere 17 years from now, we'll be capable of putting 100 people on space craft and deliver them safely to Mars! This is the first thing that struck me about this story - totally implausible. And that's before we get into the whole idea of making machines from sand, who then in turn can make other machines, who make other machines who then make every conceivable material thing a crew of 100 and then 1000's could possibly want in outer space. Never mind the dense planetary descriptions and technical psycho-babble the author uses to cover-up these wild leaps of faith. Oh, and did I mention they figured out how to stop aging, even turn the hands of time backward! That's right; these people are still screwing each other at 100 years old. Something I don't really want to think about frankly.Finally factor in the most boring characters and virtually no information of what motivates them - well, someone else said it well. This journey is a three book trilogy but I'm getting off here. The only saving grace for me is that I downloaded this to my new Kindle2 for a cost of $0.00 so all I lost was my time.
