Her last book, this enjoyable mystery revolves around a presentation of Macbeth (mostly called "the play" by the superstitious cast who feel there is a curse of sorts attached to any presentation of this work of the Bard). Fascinating characters, notably a weapons master, Gaston Sears, who not only insists on manufacturing a bona fide claymore (he uses the technically accurate term, claidheamh-mor, for the deadly two-handed blade) for use, he also choreographs the fight scene. As the director Peregrine seeks to quell any superstitious nonsense, a series of pranks occur (dummy head showing up in odd places as well as a decapitated rat), the play starts off without a hitch. Sadly, this does not remain the case, and Inspectors Alleyn and Fox must show up later when the dummy head of Macbeth on the claymore turns out to be the REAL head of Dougal Macdougal, who was playing the part. Added to the intrigue is that fact that the criminally insane father of the young actor William actually had beheaded the wife of one of the other actors and was committed to an asylum for life.The case is finally solved as a result of the young playmates of William's selection of toy soldiers to act out the parts, helping Alleyn to identify who did and how it was done. You'll have to read this well-crafted story to find out, but I can tell you this - BEWARE THE POWER OF THE CLAIDHEAMH-MOR!
