After reading The Farseer Trilogy which was very promising, I decided to take another chance with the author and try The Ship of Magic series. This first book is very silly. The concept of a liveship which speaks to it's  occupants was intriguing but it loses it's appeal as the characters were  very annoying, and the magic was very unsophisticated. I tried very hard to  find some good in this novel but it falls short of anything spectacular.  Only for the extreemely imaginative and open minded. If you have your feet  planted firmly on the ground, this fantasy novel is not for you. Goodkind  fans will find this novel a hard read. The Farseer trilogy is far better.
