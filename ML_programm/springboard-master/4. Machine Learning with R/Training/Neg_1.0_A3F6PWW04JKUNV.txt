I shouldn't complain - I was stupid enough to buy the book. The &gt;1400 pages went fast though because I skipped huge sections of text - any time he got int one of his diatribes. These are worse than anything Ayn Rand ever wrote and much stupider. And while we're at it, someone should make a top ten list of his worst dialogue. I would but I cannot bear to go back through the book.
