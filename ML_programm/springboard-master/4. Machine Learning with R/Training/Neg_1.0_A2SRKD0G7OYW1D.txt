This review is solely for the Kindle version of Executive Orders.This is one of my favorite Clancy novels.  I re-read it every few years.  I re-purchased it for the Kindle and must say that this is the most horrible conversion to Kindle I have seen to date.  It's like they just opened up the source file, did a SAVE-AS and picked Kindle format and went to market with it.  It is so full of typos and errors that it looks like it was OCRed.  I will be re-reading my hardback rather than the Kindle version.
