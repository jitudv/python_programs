First off, I have the kindle version and it works just fine, I had no problems with it at all.  Now for the review of the bookThe first few books started out with a Bang and I thought we were going to get something special and new.  Instead this book has continued what started in the 3rd book with a descent in obsessiveness with mediocre ramblings that while connected to the main story do NOT in any way move the story forward.It's turning into the Wheel of time series for being excessively wordy and boring.  I honestly think that the writer is just writing to make money and not tell a story.The writer just fails to engage beyond the interest created in the first 2 books.  Great you're trying to give us plot twists and intrigue, possible redemption for a few and definite characters that are grey, neither good or bad, just normal.That doesn't mean that the author has to spend pages and pages without moving the story forward.  At this point, I'm not sure I'm going to read the rest of the books.  I don't like getting bilked and that's what this is starting to feel like.
