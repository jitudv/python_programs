Let me start by saying that I'm not a big Clancy fan.  I read some of his stuff, but I find that his books too often drown you in pages of technical details that have little or nothing to do with the actual plot.  I find that Clancy is one of the few authors I've read where I can honestly say the movies are often better than the books.  Without Remorse is free from most of these dry details though and that makes it a great book.  I think this is because there is simply so much going on that Clancy doesn't have time to fit those details anywhere.This book is pretty unique for Clancy in that it explores the history of his recurring CIA character, John Clark (aka John Kelly).  The action and suspense in this book are, in my opinion, second to none when matched against anything else Clancy has written (or at least that I've read).  Clancy paints a great picture of a man with problems who falls for a woman with much bigger problems, all while trying to do his job for the CIA.  A must read, not for only Clancy fans, but for anyone who enjoys edge of your seat suspense.
