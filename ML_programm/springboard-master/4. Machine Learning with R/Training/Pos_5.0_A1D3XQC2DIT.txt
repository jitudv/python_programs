Water for Elephants further romanticizes the age-old dream to runaway and join the circus. Unfortunately for Jacob (our star) it was not his dream to join the circus, but rather coincidence mixed with his last hope. The story is told from two viewpoints: Jacob is now ninety-something years old and we see what has become of our young protagonist, and we see many flashback sequences to the events that took place as he traveled with the circus.As readers we are exposed to the sharp contrast between his youth and aged eras. With the circus, Jacob's life was so full of adventure and non-stop activity. Now he is resident in an assisted-living facility and he fears he is losing his energy and becoming more and more like the peers with whom he shares lodging. As he relives the excitement of his days with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth he not only longs for a different time, but resets his grip on his past. He is one old man who is not ready to give up on life.Sara Gruen gave us a beautiful story about a man who refuses to let go of the events that changed his life. As you read about Jacob your heart will break and then, if possible, it will break again. It is much more than one young man's tale of woe, however. The story is one of love, hope, never giving up and some unlikely good friends. You will laugh, worry, delight and cheer with Jacob whether he is twenty something or ninety something. I really appreciate that the author went the extra mile in her research of life in the circus.I didn't think I would like Water for Elephants, but I heard from too many people that it was good. When that happens, I had no choice but to give it a try. I really liked this book. And I'm glad I read it.
