This the last George R. R. Martin book I will waste my money and time on.  I absolutely loved the first four books of this series.  At the end of the 4th book Mr. Martin said that originally all the material was to be included in the 4th book, but since there was so much it had been divided into 2 books.  Ok.  But if that was truly the case, why did it take so long for the subsequent book to be released?  Even so, I waited until finally Dance With Dragons was released.  What a tremendous disappointment!  Absolutely NOTHING was resolved!So I'm done.  Done with this series and with George R. R. Martin.  You've gotten the last of my time and money that I'm willing to waste on this silliness.
