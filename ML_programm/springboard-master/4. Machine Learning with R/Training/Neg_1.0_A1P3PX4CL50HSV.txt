The first chapter of A Game of Thrones involved The Other's attacking and killing a group of men from the Night's Watch. After reading that introductory chapter is there anyone who would have wagered that five books later The Others would have barely appeared again and done very little when they did?This is an example of the issues with Martin's story over the last two books. New stories are being added to the narrative and the story from the first few books is is moving at a glacial pace. A story that started with 7 or 8 main characters has expanded to over 25 and the series is suffering as a result.There are long stretches in this book where nothing happens. It's  adreadfully slow read and does not match the excitement and thrills of the first three books in the series.
