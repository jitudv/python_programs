ADwD is, in my opinion, some of the best individual moments in the entire series, tied together by the same kind of plodding character work and stalling that plagued AFfC. While many events could compete with the best moments of ASoS in excitement, wow-factor, an emotional pain, there just weren't enough of them.The main three characters of the book are Jon, Dany, and Tyrion, who spend most of there time politicking and sight-seeing. If you have major enjoyment of world-building without plot, you will like this book. The book also includes many old POV's and some new ones who only show up briefly, but many of them have some exciting moments. Bran, Arya, and Cersei did great work for barely being around, as did Davos. And one old character, whose name I won't mention, turned in some of the best chapters in the whole series.The major flaw of the book, however, is that it kept building to an epic climax that had to pushed back to the next book do to print length. While that may not be as annoying once the Winds of Winter finally comes out, it it still a sin against this book. Hopefully the next book is fantastic.
