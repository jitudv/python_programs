Oh boy..!! it's a great page turner. You can't put it down until you get it over with. I completed this book in a day maybe. I'm a big fan of Psychological thrillers and this is my best book so far.Alex Cross is a common man and not some detective from any James Bond movie. He makes mistakes. He looks human. He is up against some genius psychopath. Somehow he managed to solve the case. It's a great roller coaster ride all through this book. This book will keep you thinking even after you are done with this.
