My father has this huge book collection and I remember I was around 12 when I found this book amidst a sea of books and I thought it was pretty small, so I read it in one sit...It changed my life.It talks about life, love, friendship, death, etc. All of these answers that you spend your entire life searching for...are in this book. It tells you all of these things that you already know about life, but somehow we keep in the back of our heads so we don't have to do the right thing, as if ignoring them will make us more human by default. There is no place that I go that this book doesn't follow me.I remember in college having this teacher that I despised so much and the class was talking about their favorite book and when it came my turn I said "The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran" and she got all excited too and said "That's my favorite book too, it's like my Bible"...I remember thinking "How can I have something that is so important to me in common with someone that I despise?"...I guess that's the thing about life...I will never forget that or her...
