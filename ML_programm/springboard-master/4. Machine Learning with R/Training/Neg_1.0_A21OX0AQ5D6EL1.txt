Bore me once, shame on you; bore me twice, I'm an idiot.  I refuse to (a) pay the exorbitant eBook price for "Dragons", (b) get sucker punched again by hundreds and hundreds of pages of blathering meandering exercises in how-long-can-I-stretch-out-nothing-whatsoever-happening, and (c) waste precious and non-refundable hours of my life stuck in a book written by an author who has utterly lost his passion for his own story AND any respect for his clamoring fans. He doesn't care about shortchanging his readers, I certainly don't care to fork over money to help him do so.
