This 1934 entry pretty much has it all... a large English manorial estate, a weekend party where "The Murder Game" is being played out, a Russian doctor whose specialty is ancient weapons, and of course, a murder.Inspector Roderick Alleyn is called in when a man, who was the recent recipient of an ancient and valuable Russian knife, is murdered. And his good friend was a weapons collector who wanted the knife at all costs.But another weekend guest, a quirky Russian doctor, desires the knife for yet another reason: it's morally property of an ancient (and dangerous) Russian Secret Society.There was also some hanky-panky going on between the victim and another man's wife, the jealous husband and the victim's mistress both being guests at the scene and they thus become murder suspects.In any event, said knife becomes an effective murder weapon as this elite group plays "The Murder Game". A young investigative reporter (who's there as a guest) also becomes a suspect but ends up helping Inspector Alleyn to solve the crime. There is also a sub-plot concerning the covert and nefarious activities of the Russian Secret Society in England.This is a good one -- VERY cozy! My highest recommendation.
