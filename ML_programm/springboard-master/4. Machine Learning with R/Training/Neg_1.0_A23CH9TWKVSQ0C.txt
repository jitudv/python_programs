I purchased this book based on the 31 5 star reviews. After a trip to Thailand, I wanted to learn to cook the food. I am disappointed. The format is TOO BIG 10x14"to be practical as a cookbook. Also the recipes are short on techniques--just the ingredients and basic cooking instructions. I'm donating this book to Goodwill and purchasing a real Thai cookbook.
