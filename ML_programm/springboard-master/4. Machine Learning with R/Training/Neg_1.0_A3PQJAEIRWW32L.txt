This book was an epic fail, a fantasy "Days of Our Lives" where the plot moves at a snail's pace and old familiar characters die off while new ones are introduced exponentially.I wonder if GRRRRM even knows where he is going with this book. This series has become akin to a movie that I heard was good, and started off good, but turned out to be bad, but I just keep watching either because I expect it to get better, or I have already invested so much time in it.I cannot understand why this would merit 5 stars from anyone other than those making money off of it. To me 5 stars makes it one of the all time best books I have ever read, one that I will reread again and again because it is so entertaining, one that I think fondly of, or causes me to think in new ways, or inspires me to change my life. How can this book be any of those things to anyone, even to the author?At most I would think it should get 3 stars, but that would only be due to it being part of a larger series. By itself it should get one star, if that.The only redeeming feature of the book is the cliffhanger at the end, but if that situation turns out bad (character dies) then my interest in this series as a whole will die along with him.
