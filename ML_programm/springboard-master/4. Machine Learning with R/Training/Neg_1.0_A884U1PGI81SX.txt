I felt this book was just awful and will now stop reading this series.  It offended me that reviewers thought him to be an American Tolkien when his writing and vision are so far from what Tolkien created.  Tolkien created a deep world full of challenges and magic and hope in what is good. Not to mention that his writing was transcendent.Martin creates a brutal world where babies are eaten by wargs and murders are featured as main characters and morality has little meaning.  Who really cares what happens to many of these petty characters and who cares who wins the battle for this world?  Not me any longer.  Horrible and meaningless to me.  Nothing at all to compared with Tolkien.
