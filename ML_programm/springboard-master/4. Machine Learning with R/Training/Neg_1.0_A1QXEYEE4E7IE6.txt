As a buff of Tudor history, I was shocked from the first page how incorrect the information was. Mary was not 13 or 14 when she became the mistress of Henry VIII - and, accepted historical information indicates that Mary was the OLDER sister, not the younger. What happened to the years spent in France and her being mistress to the King of France? Needless to say, just the first few pages frustrated me so badly that I ceased reading the book and shall not bother finishing it. This author has done a better job following historical information in some of her other books - I just can't imagine what happened here. And now, to think that the movie will project this information to people - but then, if they're not history buffs, they won't know any difference. It's like the cable series about The Tudors and the actor portraying Henry VIII is a scrawny little man instead of someone over 6 feet tall and well built! Oh well - Anyway, I would not recommend this book to anyone for any reason.
