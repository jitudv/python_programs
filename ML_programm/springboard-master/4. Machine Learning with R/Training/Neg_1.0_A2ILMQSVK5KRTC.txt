I don't get what all the fuss was about Hemmingway being such a great author.  This story sucked, especially the ending.  It just ends!  And what's with "rope-soled shoes"?  He must use this phrase twenty times in the first couple chapters when describing someone.  Then there's this schmuck, the main character, Robert Jordan, who has a screw loose.  He keeps having a two way conversation with himself.  I know I sometimes say something to myself like: "Boy Jeff that was a pretty stupid thing to do!", but I don't answer myself back!  About the only positive thing I can say about this book is that some of the stuff in it about suicide sheds some light on why Hemmingway blew his brains out later in life. Boy, to think that this is touted as probably Hemmingway's best work!  If that's the case then one Hemmingway book is enough for me.  Now you take Dostoyevsky, there was a writer!
