I wanted to like this book, but I could not. Maclean seems to have an encyclopedic knowledge of life aboard a cruiser, but the naval strategy that drives the book seems nonsensical. Go read C.S. Forrester's "The Ship" to see a better handling of life aboard a ship in battle.*** SPOILERS ***But the real problem with this particular book is that almost every single character is killed off. They either have a spectacularly gruesome death, or die in an act of suicidal bravery, or more likely both. How much of this can you take as reader? There's not a single bright spot in this whole book. Every time you think the mood is lifting with some character redeeming himself by an heroic act he is either blown to smithereens or frozen to death within a page or two.There's not even any logic to it all. The idea that the Admiralty would sacrifice an entire convoy just to draw out the Tirpitz is stupid. The goal of the Admiralty was to get convoys through, not sink German warships. It's the convoys that would win the war.I think Maclean was on some sort of medication when he wrote this. It's a complete downer from start to finish.
