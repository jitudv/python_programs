I bought this more-or-less on spec, on the strength of a couple of sentences of recommendation from Michael Chabon (for which many thanks, Michael).  The funny thing is that now that I have it, it is immediately obvious that while Chabon covers a fair bit of ground in his intro. one thing that he doesn't know is that Red Orm is alive and well, and familar to any six year old german boy (e.g. my two sons), in Vickie und die st&auml;rken M&auml;nner (''''''''''''), an old japanse-german animated TV series that tells the adventures of the clever red-haired Viking boy Vikkie, his girlfriend Ylvi (his mother is Ylva) and his enemy Der Schreckliche Sven, and which has been repeating forever on german TV.  It's pretty obvious, as soon as you pick up the book, and then  you run into Ylvi (and the Swedish entry for Vicke Vicking, the original book, on Wikipedia confirms it). This only makes The Long Ships even more fun to read, and is precisely the sort of configuration that MIchael Chabon of all people would appreciate.Adventures, ships, galley slaves, friends and roasted lamb round beach campfires, pretty girls, fights, axes, toledo swords, more adventures, more fights, and, of course, baddies that cry out to be played by Alan Rickman in the movie.  In short, a very superior ripping yarn for literate small boys of all ages (and sexes).  You can imagine Orm, late in life on his estate, settling down to a copy of Beowulf, ale-cup beside him, and not being terribly impressed.
