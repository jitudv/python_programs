I'm not sure what happened here. I can only guess that Martin has lost interest in this, and is dragging himself through the pages on the whipping insistence of his editor.There are flashes of what I enjoyed in the first three books, but those flashes are quickly snuffed by pages and pages of monotonous slush. Not even Tyrion can save this one.I've learned a lesson here. If you start a series, tell your story, and finish it promptly. Don't do... this.King did the same thing with The Dark Towers series. Fool me once...
