This was a great book. This was my first time reading an Alex Cross book and I am thrilled to read the rest. The book was filled with all kinds of mysteries, twists, and turns. I look forward to reading the rest of the Alex Cross series and if you love mystery/thriller/detective novels then this is the book for you
