I give 5 star ratings to books that keep me up well past my bedtime and that leave me wanting more when I get to the last page. Anyone who loves fantasy will want to read this, but the characters and action transcend the genre and should appeal to anyone who enjoys any kind of adventure. The only caution is that the violence and sexuality may offend certain readers, otherwise enjoy.
