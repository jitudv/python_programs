It reads like one of the weakest books in the WoT series.  So much useless detail that does not move the plot forward.  Remember when you had a paper that was due in two weeks and you tried and tried to write something and couldn't come up with anything.  But you put in enough filler that if changed the spacing to 1.5 and picked a different font you would get your minimum 10 pages, 8 of which was just restating the question ?  Yeah that paper is pretty much this book.
