The Wine-Dark Sea  by Patrick O'BrianThere are few prose stylists writing today who can compare with Patrick O'Brian for the smooth, evocative and fluid stories which come from his pen.  This book, a  particularly fine example of O'Brian's craft, is part of his Aubrey/Maturin  series of sea-faring novels.  Sailor Jack Aubrey, while a typically  crusty man of the blue briny, is also a well-read and witty contrast and  companion to Doctor Stephen Maturin, an erudite physician with a huge love  of the sea.  Together, the two have had many adventures, but in The  Wine-Dark Sea, they face some of their greatest challenges ever with  remarkable spirit and aplomb.  The story here is great entertainment with  lots of page-turning action, but the lush writing is simply seductive and  so easy to become lost and quite "at sea" within.  While these are often  consider "men's books," I strongly suspect that many women would be  attracted to the strong plots, grand characterization, and fine writing;  there is never the least hint of the crude or the coarse in these highly  literate, but so readable novels.  I have often suggested the works of  Patrick O'Brian to writing students as a model for crisp, fresh, lively  prose and most highly recommend this series to anyone who loves a great  read.
