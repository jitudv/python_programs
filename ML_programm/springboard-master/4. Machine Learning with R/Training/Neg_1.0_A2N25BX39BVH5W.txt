The gimmick of this book and its translation is that it doesn't use the letter 'e' anywhere in the story. To make up for that, the writer uses 3 or 4 words to describe what a single word containing the letter 'e' would have described succinctly and more adequately. So the book is a jumbled mass of text that is difficult to read and even more difficult to care about the story or the characters. I got through 30 pages before I stopped reading. It was hard to go from reading Atonement by Ian McEwan to this frivolous mess of a book. Worst part was it took 2 weeks to arrive from an overseas book seller, and the wait was not worth it. I almost gave this book as a Christmas present... got lucky I decided against it even before trying to read it.
