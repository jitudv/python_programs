It's true that historical fictional novels don't have to stick strictly to facts. But "The Other Boleyn Girl" is completely unconvincing as a novel, not because of its sensationalism, exaggeration, and gross misrepresentation of historical facts, but the dubious characterisation of the two sisters. Mary is the innocent, sweet, moral heroine who is forced to become the King's mistress due to her family's hunger for power. Anne is the cold and calculating villain whose every word points to her monstrous greed and selfishness. The characters are very much one-dimensional, it's like reading a children's fairy tale about how a beautiful and kind heroine fights off the mean and ugly baddies.Gregory's idea of Mary narrating England's most famous historical affair is brilliant. She had an opportunity to write a brilliant masterpiece to both entertain and stimulate. Despite the popularity of the novel my personal reaction to TOBG is that it's tedious and distasteful. This book belongs in the soft porn section of stores rather than works of historical fiction. The dialogues are so vulgar and unrealistic as conversations of two upper-class sisters in the 16th century England. To me they sounded like something you'd read in a trashy magazine article by a prostitute who didn't pass high school English.
