Gypped and hoodwinked again!  After the first three imaginative, action-packed volumes, the last two have been pathetically painful. I was hoping Martin had taken some advice from his fans after the disaster that was A Feast for Crows.  Apparently not.  Obviously, Martin is going for the "stretching out the series with filler trash a la Robert Jordan show-me-the-money" angle, and abandoning all pretense of imagination, decent writing and character development. Why do these series have to go on and on if there's nothing worth reading? Amping up the soft porn and vulgar language is the only nod to "action" anywhere in this book, maybe a boon to all the lonely nerds camped out in their parents' basements, but not to me.Too many characters discussing nothing, endless repetition of themes (yes, we know Daenerys is unsure, young, and horny.  WHERE ARE THE DRAGONS???  Yes, we know Theron has broken teeth and missing fingers and Ramsay is a sadistic monster.  WHEN IS THE REVENGE??? Yes, we know Jon Snow is young, unsure and being challenged at every turn.  WHEN DOES HE TAKE CHARGE??? Lord Manderly is slovenly, the Lannisters are cruel, Tyrion is the misunderstood Imp, etc, etc) It takes 500+ pages for anything to happen, and it didn't tie up all the unraveling threads of endless characters no one cares about. Creating new characters is no substitute for a good story.Boring boring boring.  A shameful sputtering end to a promising beginning.
