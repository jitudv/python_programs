Several years ago I read "A Game of thrones". I simply loved it. Martin created a world that was alive and more real than our own because, unlike most books of the genre, both the narrative and characterization were realistic even if the setting was a world where each season lasted several decades."A Dance with Dragons" in comparison, but also on its own, is a pretty bad book, a promise unfulfilled. In a thousand pages the characters of this book travel thousands of miles: they depart from nowhere and they arrive nowhere too. I don't want to spoil anything but one new character seemed to be created only because Martin is running out of characters to kill and he still has, apparently, two books to go.He created a Red Shirt.This was a great series but the last two books were a disaster worse, they were boring. It pains me a lot buy I only gave it one star because that is the lowest rating available.
