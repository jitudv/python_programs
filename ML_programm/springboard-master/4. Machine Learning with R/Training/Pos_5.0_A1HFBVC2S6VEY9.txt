I was fascinated by the dreadful mistakes the British government made leading up to WWII. I knew nothing except the names of Churchill and Chamberlain before reading this book, but now I can talk about the British side of WWII almost as well as I can the Australian and the American. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in WWII or political intrigue.
