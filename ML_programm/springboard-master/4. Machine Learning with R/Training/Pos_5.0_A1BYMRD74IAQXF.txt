Although I read some bad reviews for this 5th book , I had looked forward to reading it and wasn't put off by said reviews . I am so happy that I ignored them.  A Dance with Dragons didn't disappoint . Now I can't wait for the 6th book . Another book you won't want to put down . So many twists and turns , Mr. Martin keeps you on the edge constantly .
