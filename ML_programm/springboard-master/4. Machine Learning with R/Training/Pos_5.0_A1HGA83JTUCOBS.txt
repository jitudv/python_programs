At the beginning it was difficult to follow because of all the new characters he was introducing. But eventually I got into it. The detail that Martin uses to describe someone's outfit paints an excellent picture.I also enjoy his description of a meal, whether a rather simple meal or a 7-course meal. Especially since most of what we are dealing with is not something you find in a local 5-star restaurant, get my mouth starts watering.When reading a couple books at the same time, I usually can't wait to get back to Martin because his writing is head-and-shoulder above whatever else I am reading.
