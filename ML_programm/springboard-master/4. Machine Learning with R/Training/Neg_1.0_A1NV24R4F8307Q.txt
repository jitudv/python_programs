The first couple of volumes of this series were truly intriguing.  It was a little off-putting that Martin's proven creativity was a little lacking with the obvious theme for the work being the English Wars of the Roses with a map that looked suspiciously like England (including Hadrian's Wall), two contending families, Stark (York) and Lannister (Lancaster) and knights being called "ser" instead of "sir."  But he told a rousing good tale anyway.  After investing many hours reading the now five 1,000-page installments, we deserve better than people just going and going from place to place.  I know he's busy doing his HBO mini-series on this subject, but he needs to wrap this baby up before he dies on us.  I'd recommend just skipping this volume and hoping that the next one is the finale.  You won't miss much.  He definitely phoned this one in.
