This was such a let down. I can't understand why anyone would give this book five stars. This really has nothing to do with survival. I read the description and table of contents before buying, which lead me to believe that this book would offer practical advice for living in the city when things get dangerous. It does not. This is only a book for a person without common sense advising how to live within a normal day without killing or maiming yourself with your own stupidity. The best information was the section on first aid. However, if you ever took a babysitting course or did any sort of boy scouts or girl scouts, you already know more than what is in this book.
