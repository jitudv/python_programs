I put off writing this review for a while.  I could not make it through this book. This book and "A Feast for Crows" have convinced me that Martin has totally lost control of the plot of this series.  There are far too many unresolved, pointless plot lines and characters.  At this point, it seems that Martin is including random thoughts into the story without any consideration of how they advance the plot.  I've given up on this series and would not recommend it to anyone.  Hard core fans will disagree, but there are far better books to read.
