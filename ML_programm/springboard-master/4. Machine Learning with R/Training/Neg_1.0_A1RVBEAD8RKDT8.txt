That's what this book seemed to be...Endless.  It went ON and ON and ON  with irrelevant details about the main couples' relationship.  It takes over half this book just for them to get together.This book is NOT Christie's usual style.  This book takes a VERY slow build to an eventual murder that doesn't occur until 3/4 of the way through the book.  By that time...you just don't care.  The supporting characters appear in only brief moments.  Much of the action takes place "off the page" and you just hear about it after-the-fact.  Some of these things are significant.  Christie does a lot of telling and NOT showing in this book which makes it hard to get involved in.  The narrator is just reciting everything in his recollection.This is also one of Christie's last books and you can definitely tell.  Her writing style and format is completely different in this book.  She doesn't just stick to the facts and keep the story moving.  Instead...she's always up inside the main character's mind, constantly telling us what he's thinking and feeling and NOT keeping the story rolling along.  It's almost like she was trying to match the literary style of more contemporary writers of the time--1960's & 70's.  It does NOT work. I admire any artist for trying something new, but she needed to stick with the style she does best:  intro of suspects, murder, investigation...wrap up.I love Christie, but I cannot recommend this book.  It's not big, but I kept putting it down and it took me weeks to finish it.  If you want a great psychological mystery from Christie, go for Sleeping Murder and Toward Zero.  These are two of her BEST.
