This book has about one-fifth the "story line" even of book 4, and instead fills the pages with excruciatingly detailed descriptions of the bloody flux, greyscale, bad weather and maggoty food.  NOT what one would expect from the author being touted as the "American Tolkein."It's utterly unsatisfying, to the point where I am dumping it and the other 4 books at the local library.If you feel compelled to read it, just to find out how bad it is for yourself, at least don't spend any money on it.  Go get it at the library.  You'll feel slightly less ripped off that way
