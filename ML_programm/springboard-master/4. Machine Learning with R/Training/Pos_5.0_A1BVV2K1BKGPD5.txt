Having read all of Tom Clancy's books, this is the gem that stands out way above all the rest.  It has adventure and danger, as do all his books, but it deals with love and heartbreak to a degree not seen in his other books.  This book is very much about honor and duty, sacrifice and betrayal.  There are many segments of this book which are unforgettable!  This book is one of a kind in its genre and is well deserving of the label &quot;Modern  Classic.&quot;  In this book we see the beginnings of a central character in several Clancy books written earlier, but chonologically later in time, the enigmatic Mr Clark.  No problem is too difficult for Mr Clark in the other novels, and now we know why.  I strongly encourage all adventure/espionage genre fans to read this book, as well as other readers looking for a compelling read.  This is the best of Tom Clancy and that is saying something very strong indeed.
