In Water for Elephants, the reader is treated to views of very different worlds. One is the present day, real-life existance of elderly residents in an assisted living facility. Their story is told through the eyes of a "90-something" year old man recuperating from a broken hip. At the same time, this character, Jacob we learn is his name, regales us with  life as a member of a circus from the past. Both stories are filled with such strong detail that we as the reader, are drawn back and forth from the past to the present in gentle surprise. We are introduced to the emotional roller-coaster details of a young man's life, many of which he is not a willing participant. However, we learn that he has a depth of character and courage that carries him through life's troubles when many of us today would want to give up. We find him using those same character traits to overcome some "curve-ball throws" that at "93", life is still pitching his way. Ms. Gruen has done a superb job of blending the past and present, and even gives us a hint of the future of this gallant man's life. Her book is so well researched that the reader might begin to feel it is a biography rather than fiction. This book will hold your interest throughout, especially the tales of the circus from a by-gone era and even the unfortunate activities of life in elder-care facilities that haunt us today. However, she does not leave us feeling sad and remiss about a touchy subject, but instead gives us a surprise ending that is upbeat and hopeful.By: Sherry M. Airey
