Another fine work from my favorite guy that's got great action, pacing and, above all, characterizations.  The people in this story were very real to me and the society in which they live seemed very plausible.  The meandering and intersection of the characters' fates is set against an impending climax that we know is coming from the beginning of the story and when it arrives, it's thrilling and very moving.  I loved this one.
