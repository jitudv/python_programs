I was really looking forward to reading this book, especially after seeing the previews for the upcoming movie.  I must say that it is one of the worst books I have ever read and I have been an avid reader my entire life.  I couldn't relate or get attached to the main character, Jacob, except at certain points when he was elderly.  I actually felt very embarrassed for the author while reading the many squalor erotica scenes that did nothing to help me connect or care for any of the characters.  I was expecting a heartfelt romance, but the characters, including the love interest, Marlena, are so one dimensional that I found the whole thing absurd and unbelievable.  I kept trying to get into it and hoped it would get better as it went along, but no such luck.  If you must read it, try to borrow it instead of buying or see if you can pick up a cheap copy at a thrift store.  Better yet, spend your time reading something with a convincing story and engaging characters instead.
