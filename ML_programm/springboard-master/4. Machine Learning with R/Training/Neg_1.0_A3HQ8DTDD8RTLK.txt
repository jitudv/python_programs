I'm glad I got this book for free.  I'd hate to think I wasted money on it.The writer spends and exorbitant amount of time describing the characters feelings and thoughts to the point that it is boring to the extreme.  I didn't even make it to the end of the first section before deciding that life was too short to keep trying to read this book.  Maybe if the author had Chamberlain and Churchill go after each other with broadswords and dueling pistols in the London Underground it would have at least have had a little action and been more interesting.
