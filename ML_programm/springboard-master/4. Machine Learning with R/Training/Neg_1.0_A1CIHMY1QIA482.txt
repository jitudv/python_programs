I loved "Lady of Hay", so when my library bought this one, I borrowed it immediately.  What a waste of time!  The plot just keeps repeating itself over and over and then just...........ends!  There is no denouement, no tying together of loose ends, nothing.  It just stops.  She gives a feeble excuse as to why she did this, but come ON.  I think she just wanted her paycheck from the publisher.
