With "HMS Ulysses," his first novel, Alistair MacLean established himself as a writer with a flair for action, humor, and pulse-pounding plots. He showed a penchant for capturing the heroism of men in tough spots, the cold of icy environments, and the crash of the waves on the high seas. He gained fame through books such as "Ice Station Zebra," "The Guns of Navarone," and "Where Eagles Dare," but some of his later books seemed to devolve into predictable affairs."HMS Ulysses" still stands as a remarkable first novel and as a classic of war on the sea. With nail-biting scenes and teeth-grinding suspense, the story shows the fight for survival of men aboard a ship. I miss the straightforward storytelling of dear Mr. MacLean. I sincerely hope his books remain with us, to be passed to the next generation.
