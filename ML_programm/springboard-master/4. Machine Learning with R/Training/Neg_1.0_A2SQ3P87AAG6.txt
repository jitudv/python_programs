I didn't read Sydney Sheldon in my teens in the nineties when all around me were devouring them. I just stuck my nose up at that popular culture. It was only last year 2013 that I decided to see what all the fuss had been about. Master of the Game was alright in the way you'd expect a popular paperback to be. But this one If Tomorrow Comes was utter nonsense and ridiculous-in fact down right irritating. I do not recommend this book to anyone with an IQ rating of above 1.5
