Water for Elephants is the definitive  novel on love and compassion in the midst of unspeakable pain and despair. It is on my list of five best and most unexpected endings mainly for the secret that Jacob keeps his whole life.  There are so many incredible little secrets about life in this book just waiting to be discovered.  The plot is riveting.  It's an incredibly fast read and it is truly as magical as a circus.
