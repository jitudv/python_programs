Game of Thrones is one of the rare instances where the movie/TV show is MUCH better than the book.  The HBO series trims out all the bloated, boring, aimless overly detailed fat from book.  The show is awesome.  Skip the books - especially this 5th one.  Dance with Dragons is so painful and boring, it is just not worth it when you will be able to watch the show instead.
