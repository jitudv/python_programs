The audio cassette of &quot;Sahara&quot; was so bad, in my opinion, that it does not deserve a review from someone of my caliber.My wife and I put it in the car when we went on an overnighter to get away from the kids a week or so ago.  We listened to it for about 20 minutes into the drive and then shut it off, it was so lame.I finished it a while later on my commute to and from work.  After having finished it, all I can say is that I am glad I do not have to listen to Tom Wompat try and sound like the sexy Eva Rojas anymore, it was almost nauseating.This is my second Clive Cussler book in the last month and I have to say he is not as good as I remember him.  I remember really liking &quot;Treasure&quot; quite a few years ago when I was still a kid.I have now listened to &quot;Sahara&quot; and have read &quot;Shock Wave&quot; in the last month and both have been so unbelievable that they were actually funny at times.
