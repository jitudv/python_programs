I JUST LOVE CS LEWIS. IN THIS BOOK I HAVE FOUND A VERITABLE FEAST OF INTELLECTUAL CHALLENGES THAT SHAKE MY PRE-DISPOSED ATTITUDES AND HANG-UPS TOWARD GOD AND MAN. THIS BOOK OFFERS THE READER A CHALLENGE TO SEE MY RELATIONSHIP TO GOD IN A CLEAR LIGHT. IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT LIFE CAN BRING, AND DON'T MIND YOUR PREDILECTIONS TOWARD THE ETERNAL BEING DISTURBED, CHALLENGED, AND CHANGED, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU.
