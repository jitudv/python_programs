I picked this book up in Bangkok as I was browsing through a second hand book store, and didn't expect much until I read that this was a novel by the guy who wrote House of Cards, To Play the King and The Final Cut.As mentioned above, this covers the events leading up to World War 2.  It provides a great insight into the behind the scenes goings-on in parliament, the rivalries and treacheries in the run up to Winston Churchill becoming Britains war time Prime Minister.It's a superb read, really gripping from the first page through to the end.  Definately recommended for anyone who has an interest in WW2, Churchill or British history.  In fact, I would definately recommend this to anyone, it's easy going and difficult to put down.
