From the opening lines, "When I look over the first twenty-five years of my life and consider the number of times I was in danger of losing it," the reader is swept up into the majestic mind and spirit of the iconic Elizabeth I. Jean Plaidy began writing historical fiction in the fifties, and to the modern-day reader she may seem a tad dated and naive; yet her consummate command of history and ability to effortlessly transition from scene to scene are commanding and refreshing in an era of overheated fiction and an emphasis on the lurid.A friend loaned me this book; I found it captivating and immensely easy to read, even as I learned about Elizabeth and her times. This is a vastly different Elizabeth from the devious narcissist of Philippa Gregory's works or the volatile spirited girl of C.W.Gortner's book, but she is worth exploring all the same.
