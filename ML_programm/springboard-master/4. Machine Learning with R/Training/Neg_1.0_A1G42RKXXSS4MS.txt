I had just finished reading "The Autobiography of Henry VIII: With Notes By His Fool, Will Somers" by Margaret George and was interested in learning more about about that time. A group of acquaintances heartily & gushingly recommended "The Other Boleyn Girl".Fortunately, my copy came from a thrift store, because I cannot finish it. I'm not even at page 75 yet and I'm seriously hating it. The most eye-rolling passage for me was Mary's description of her stay at her family's country estate all by herself (with the exception of the  servants), and her discussions with local farmers, plus the story about how she secured seed for a crop for some of them. Please.If Ms. Gregory is the feminist she claims to be, she would do well to write more accurately about history and and less sensationally. The truth is usually much more interesting anyway.I'll be combing these 1 and 2 star reviews for recommendations of better accounts of the time and of Anne Boleyn.
