The story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn has been well-chronicled, but author Philippa Gregory succeeds in making history come alive in her lively retelling.  She tells her story from the point of view of Mary, Anne's sister, who is referred to as "the other Boleyn girl".  Mary and Anne are depicted as true products of the Howard and Boleyn families, enemies when in competition for the same thing and allies when there is a threat to them and their family.  They do the bidding of their elders who only care about advancing the family power and fortune.  Their parents are cold and uncaring and their uncle is calculating and willing to sacrifice his nieces for his own gain.  Anne is groomed to be the King's mistress during his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, with the hope of succeeding her as queen.  Instead she is supplanted by her own sister, Anne, and is betrayed by her family and by the king.  The court of Henry VIII is portrayed as a dangerous place, with shifting loyalties and alliances, and every man out for his own profit.  Even though the reader knows the final outcome of Anne's story, author Gregory manages to make it a suspenseful climax.
