I thought Martin had hit rock bottom in the last book, so I thought 'no where to go but up', right?  WRONG!  Sideways is evidently a new direction for authors, who have obviously never taken 10th grade English and do not know what plot sequence means.I do not know who the other 3000 or so people are who gave this book 3,4,or 5 stars, but they must be on someone's payroll, (wink wink), because this series is just getting worse and worse. Do not waste your money. I used an Amazon credit, so thankfully, I am not feeling too swindled. If you feel you must read this, get it from the Library.
