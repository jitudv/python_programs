It is a true masterpiece in which almost every, if not every word counts.  I have read it over and over again, since a girlfriend gave me a copy just before I left for Berkeley to attend law school.  I have given copies to many friends, and recommended to others that they buy it and read it carefully.There is enormous wisdom in each chapter, especially given the materialistic and secular world in which we live - which often seems for many people to be devoid of meaning or any spiritual underpinnings.  Gibran cuts through to the beauty and essence of Life, and his words are just as profound today as when they were written in the early years of the last century.This book should be recommended reading for any young person who is old enough to wonder what Life is really all about.  Indeed, it can be picked up at any age, and it offers insights that are brilliant and beautifully written.I urge anyone, who is thinking about buying it, to do so.  Just peruse a copy at a local bookstore or library, and you are apt to become enthralled.  It may take several readings to soak up its essence; and even after many years, I still find nuances and learn more each time I reread it.
