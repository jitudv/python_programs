This book is a horrid combination of writing that is good enough to keep you reading and bad enough that you wish you weren't.  The book is 700+ pages.  The heroine is repeatedly raped (forceably and not) or otherwise abused by men who supposedly love her.  She repeatedly makes stupid choices, leaving the reader to wonder how "smart" she really is.  There are too many irrelevant characters.  The ending is completely unsatisfying, given how long I spent to slog through the book.  The author is not bad in terms of description, but the only real element of "suspense" will be figured out by a thinking reader by page 100 or so of the book and is not nearly enough to carry a reader happily through to page 700.  Avoid this book.
