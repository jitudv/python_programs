I found myself drawn into this story very quickly.  I liked how "human" all the characters showed themselves to be--both good and bad.At times, I felt sorry for almost everyone, and at times, I disliked many of the characters, but I could always identify with certain choices they made.I've not read many novels regarding England and the painful subject of slavery--and it's handled very well here.  I also liked learning about the shipping business in this era.This is a interesting novel.
