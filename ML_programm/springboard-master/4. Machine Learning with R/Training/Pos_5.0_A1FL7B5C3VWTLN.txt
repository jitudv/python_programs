Excellent background research, compelling character developement and keen pychological insight make this one of the best historical novels on the market. Philippa Gregory has that gift, she can take historical characters that the average person knows very little about and make them fascinating and disturbingly real. This was an engaging and satisfying read and I heartily recommend it.
