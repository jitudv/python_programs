I have read many reviews that agree with my feelings of what is wrong with this book and state them very well.  I will not go into too much detail, but the flaws are lack of editing, lack of story progression, too many cliffhangers, and too many characters. Every character almost seems to be traveling slowly somewhere but they never arrive.The book had some good stuff hidden in the dreck. Particularly the Theon/Reek stuff was not bad.  I almost gave it two stars but really feel the book along with book 4 really drags a good series down. Also, the violence level was amped way up (in a series already known for its violence) and it felt gratuitous rather than adding to the story. Overall it felt like the events in this book could have been summed up in one prologue chapter at the start of the next novel and would have been more satisfying of a read.  Hope the next book is better. Will probably read it since I like the show and have read this far., but won't rush to get it.
