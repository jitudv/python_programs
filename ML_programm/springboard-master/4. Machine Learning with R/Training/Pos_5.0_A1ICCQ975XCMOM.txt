Mars might as well be Long Island, NY or any other Earth area where environmentalists are battling developers. The terraforming movement in &quot;Red Mars&quot; comes into conflict with those who want to leave Mars as &quot;red&quot; as we found it, moving the plot along nicely in this book and its sequels. But what really drives this book are strong characterizations...men and women who have believable motivations and interactions (loves, enemies, and sometimes combinations of the two).Although the series peters out a bit by the third book, it is an extremely worthwhile read and should satisfy fans who like hard science as well as those seeking character-driven plots. &quot;Red Mars&quot; is one of the modern classics that deserves to be read and reread!
