I understand that fiction is not always true-to-life.  But this story is SO far-fetched that it just makes bad fiction.  From beginning to end, it is just nonsense. There really is no other word to describe it.  I don't understand the raving reviews by some of the people on here. They must not read very much. I have enjoyed other books by Lisa Scottoline. This one is just awful.
