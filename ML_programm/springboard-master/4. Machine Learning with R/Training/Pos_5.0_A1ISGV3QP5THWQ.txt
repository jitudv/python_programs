I try to read anything written by this author and this book did not disappoint. His character development is clear and the timelines are consistant with the historical events he refers to in the story. Overall entertaining and, as with his other books, hold your attention. My one complaint would be that it takes almost the entire book for the obvious to be stated by the main characters.
