I loved the first three books of the series but the fourth seemed half a book and went nowhere (not surprisingly since Martin claimed that it was half of a book and the other half would be out in no time). After five years we get this absolutely worthless excuse for a book. Chapter after chapter introduces one or two characters, moves the plot forward infinitesimally and then skips onto the next. Half way through I realised that even if I finished the book there would still be TWO MORE to come (by 2023 given his present pace). I think that he has written himself into a corner, he has no idea of how the plot will end, if it ever will.
