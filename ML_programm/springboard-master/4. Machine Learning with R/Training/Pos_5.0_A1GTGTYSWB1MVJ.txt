Book two of the Aubrey/Maturin series. I have a feeling this series will stand up forever. It&#8217;s just so well done, from the research, to the authenticity, to the classiness of the writing itself. It&#8217;s charming and beautiful and a hell of a pleasure to read. The relationship between Jack and Stephen is still my favorite thing and continues to delight me. This is a wonderful series, O&#8217;Brian has recreated a real living and breathing world and I&#8217;m reading it slow because I don&#8217;t want it to end.
