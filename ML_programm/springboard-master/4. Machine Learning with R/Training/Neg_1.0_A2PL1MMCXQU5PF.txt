This book has been a huge disappointment.  I keep reading it hoping a real story will develop.  Yes, the science of terraforming Mars is intriguing, but all too simplistic in Robinson's account.  The characters are paper thin and for the most part ANNOYING.  The only real character is conveniently disposed of just as an actual plot was developing.  The only reason I will finish this is is out of a hope that Frank, Maya, Hiroko and the rest of the annoying lot will somehow meet a cruel and painful death at the hands of Ray Bradbury and Edgar Rice Burroughs at the end.  If you want a classic about Mars, go read Bradbury's &quot;Martian Chronicles.&quot;
