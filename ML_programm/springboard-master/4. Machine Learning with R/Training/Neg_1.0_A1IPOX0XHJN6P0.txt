With over 1400 other reviews, I don't see much point in being long-winded. If only Martin felt the same. Another 1000 pages and nothing really happens. Too many characters, too little movement, too little resolution, too little action, and I find that I've really stopped caring. I'm actually only 2/3 of the way through the book, and I'm not sure I'll bother finishing.That's sad. The first 3 were so good....
