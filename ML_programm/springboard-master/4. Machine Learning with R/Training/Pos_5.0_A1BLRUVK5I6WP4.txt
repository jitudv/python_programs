Herman Wouk's book The Winds Of War is near perfect. The twelve years of research Mr. Wouk put into this book is a historical fiction lover's dream. He somehow manages to take a lot of dry information and turn it into fascinating, can't put down, reading. I came away from this book with a better and clearer understanding of WW2 than I have ever had before.The Henry family are the main characters of the story, with Captain Victor "Pug" Henry, a Naval Officer, as the head of it. None of the characters are really all that well fleshed out, there is just way to much going on in this story for there to be time to go too deep, but it all seems to work to make a very enjoyable and fascinating story that is hard to put down.This is definitely a "can't put down" book but I actually found myself taking my time to read it and savor it because I didn't want it to come to an end. This is a huge book (1056 pages) but I didn't find any part of it that dragged at all. I am so happy there is a sequel. Even after reading this 1000 plus page book I am ready to dive right into the second equally large book about the Henry family and the continuation of WW2.This is one of those special rare books that only comes along once in a long while...books you wish you could read again for the first time.
