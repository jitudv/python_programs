I truly believe that Patterson believes three-fourths of the world (if not  more) is illiterate.  This book irritated the hell out of me.  For goodness  sakes, I am a sentient, intelligent person who can structure a sentence and  appreciate a good phrase.What is this regurgitated madness? Yada,  yada, yada.Stop pandering for the sake of a buck.  One word to the  reader: NEXT!!!Smooches!
