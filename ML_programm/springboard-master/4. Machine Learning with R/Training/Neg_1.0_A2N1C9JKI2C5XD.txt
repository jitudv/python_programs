I didn't like it, honestly.  People consider the Alex Cross trilogy thrillers, (If you call them thrillers at all...I just call them straight out slow paced and boring) fast paced.  They're not fast paced! There's hardly any good action scenes and gun battles, no Shoot 'em up lethal weapon stuff, which was what I expected yet didn't get it.  The only reason that people consider this book fast paced is because of the short chapters.  Yeah, I admit it, there are some very short chapters.  Lots.  But that doesn't mean that it's fast paced.  It's fast paced compared to Stephen King, but I think it's a slow paced book.  I want action.  I want adventure.  The killer kills a lot of people.  I didn't need disgusting and awful as well as dull details that James Patterson gives out.  And also, Patterson had a good chance to make this a good cop thriller.  He failed miserably.  I don't think I've ever read a good detective novel...all I want is a book with a bunch of action scenes.  If you think this is fast paced, good for you.  But if you desire more action, more events, more UNPREDICTABLENESS, then go to a different book.  I don't know which one, since I've never read one like that...anyways, don't get this book.
