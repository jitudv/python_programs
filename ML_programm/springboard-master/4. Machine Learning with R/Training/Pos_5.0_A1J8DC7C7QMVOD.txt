I found this book in a package of the Fionavar Tapestry on the &quot;for sale&quot; shelf of my fantasy bookstore Nebula. I picked it up, read the first page, and the next, and the third, and the next, and would have kept  going if the clerk hadn't come by and told me &quot;Look, you can read it  all in here, but you'd be more comfortable at home!&quot;So I bought it.  And devoured it.I love the fact that there are not only two sides:  darkness and light, good and evil, but three: darkness, gray, light, good,  unknown, evil. I find Guy Kay's writing quite poetic, and I enjoyed every  line and every character.
