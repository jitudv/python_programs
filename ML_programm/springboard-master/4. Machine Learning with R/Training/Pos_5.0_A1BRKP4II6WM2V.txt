Well who would have thought it, I actually made it to Heaven. They let me in on a technicality, I believe. It seems I passed the test for honesty and truthfulness. All right, only to myself, but that's a lot better than the pious hypocrites back on Earth who praise the Lord on Sundays and blast the Heathen every which way till Fridays.Not that all is well, mind. The chap who said you go to Hell for the company knew what he was talking about. This place is as full of bores as the Lords before Reform.Not only bores, but some of my old sparring partners have turned up, or rather, were waiting at the gates for me with heavenly knuckle dusters. Sergeant Hudsen, for one. You'll remember him. He was the brave idiot who killed the four Ghastlies, as I call 'em, back in Afghanistan. And Scud East, though he, of course, has forgiven me.Oh well, I guess I must make do as usual. At least there are no blasted Bishops.Flashman at the Charge (Flashman)
