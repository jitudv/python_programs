This book opens with an intriguing situation, one in which the central character goes out on a limb and takes up a preposterous proposal from a total stranger. Instead of drawing in with a question and then gradually exposing a clever answer, the book just keeps piling up question after question after question. After awhile, the questions are not of the charitable sort. It is not just that the story is preposterous. It is that I finished with no idea what on earth THAT was all about. I'm not even sure what she was trying to say. There wasn't a character in it for whom I felt any affection, either, although a lot of them would be exceedingly hard to live with. I got very tired of the old aunt who was supposedly a bit shallow and intellectually slow and who was yet so extremely insightful at the same time. I wish that in the end it that someone had "discovered" that the old bat was pulling everyone's leg the whole time, but that never happened. Likewise, I had hoped that the author was going to spring it off on us at the last minute, letting us know what all those odd leads were about, that she was surely not as dotty as she seemed to be, but that never happened, either.It's a book that few of us have ever heard of. Let's just say: There is Reason for That.
