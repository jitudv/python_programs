How people can make these types of mistakes is beyond me. There appears to have been no editor or proofreading before putting this up for sale and apparently no quailty control measures on Amazon's part. The problems:1. 4,500 locations or 450 pages are missing. This ebook is 500 locations or 50 pages.2. The reviews posted on the &#34;Kindle Store&#34; were clearly for the hard copy version3.  This &#34;book&#34; give a page or two &#34;outline&#34; of a topic. Example- there is no information detailing the seven churches like in the hard copy version just a 2 page turn &#34;outline&#34; saying the Book of Revelations speaks about seven churches.4. Complete information is just missing. The table of content looks consistent with the hard copy version yet once you spend $3.99 to buy it and click on a TOC link subtiles are not there.5. This ebook is just a very brief overview of what is in the Book of Revelations and what is in Larkin's actual book.I will be getting a refund from Amazon.
