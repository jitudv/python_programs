Rough Justice is little more than an exercise in exaggerated formulaic writing. All of Ms. Scottoline's characters are two dimensional caricatures. The heros are all female. The villains are all male. The situations overreach and are scarcely believable. The interactions between male and female characters are so misandrous that even male children are portrayed as mean spirited, dishonest and corrupt. The primary antagonists are shown to be either murderers, brutes, and  malicious malefactors of one kind or another, or utterly emasculated wimps with nothing better to do than fetch baby formula and cower before the tirades of other overbearing males. I found this book to be shallow, uninteresting and fundamentally bereft of any redeeming value. I would not recommend reading it to anyone, except perhaps those who share Ms. Scottoline's investment in misandry.
