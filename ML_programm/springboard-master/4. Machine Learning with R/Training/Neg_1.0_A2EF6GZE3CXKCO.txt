I would like to preface this review but stating that I am a huge GRRM fan. A Song of Ice and Fire is one of my favorite reads. That was until this book. I have just now finished the 959 page torment. I bought this book the day it was released and I have now only just finished reading this 4 months later.I will agree with the other reviewers that this book was way to long and said absolutely nothing. What has George done with my Starks? I fell in love with this family, he made me fall in love with this family and now what? NOTHING, that's right NOTHING. I loved the whole direwolf connection and I am still waiting for Arya to come home and kick some A$$. But no, she is still in a temple doing NOTHING. What has happened to the strong women in this story. In this book Dany was weak and whiney and love sick. There were chapters upon chapters of nothingness.I will most likely buy and read the next book when it comes out 5 years from now because I feel like I have invested time from my life I will never get back.Dear George,I need some resolution. I have stuck by you for a very long time now and feel like as with most men you finished the best part way to early. Please don't write another 959 page book about boats and urinating and what people are wearing and dragons who don't do anything. I don't know if I could take that. I will conclude this rant buy saying there are way to many new characters in this story that no one cares about. They do NOTHING but fill paper. Please George get back to the "meat" of your world. Stop taking us places no one wants to go. You need to reread the first three books again and rekindle your love of these characters that we, your readers, have come to care about. Also, FIRE your editor.
