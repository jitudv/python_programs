I pre-ordered ADWD and I repurchased and reread the first four books.ADWD SUCKS!!!!! AHHHHH! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! This book was SUCH a disappointment.Let's be clear, I enjoy Mr. Martins' writing style. His depth of character, wicked twists, breathtaking descriptions and a world that is unique and realistic.However, this particular book SUCKED BEYOND ALL THAT HAS EVER SUCKED BEFORE!!! I feel that this book is a stalling tactic for the HBO series to pull new fans into the series (AND the next two books) in order to make as much money as possible. I think Mr. Martin is fully aware of the suckyness of ADWD, and as a fan all I can do is SMDH. Shame on you Mr. Martin! It could still be good even if it was just a place holder!This book was a drag, a bunch of new characters I DO NOT CARE ABOUT (I have been trained by Mr. Martins previous 4 books not to care too much for any character as they may be killed off at the drop of a dime) I was bored with all the traveling here and sailing there and eating locusts and puppies and other nasty stuff, and still not tying up any conflicts, old or new, just creating more and more and more conflicts. Enough is enough. I first started the series 2001 and I am too through! I have also told all my friends and family who I bragged and bragged to about this series to that it is a big fat waste of time. I am selling my books to a newbie to the series. They won't know any better. SMDH.
