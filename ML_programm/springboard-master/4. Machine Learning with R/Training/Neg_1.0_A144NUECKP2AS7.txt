The initial story line appeared to be sound and could possibly be interesting. But the author's treatment of the characters and twisted scenarios left me cold and disgusted. I never actually got to book five, having given up and abandoned the story on book two. There are good sword and sorcery tales out there but this is not one as far as I am concerned.
