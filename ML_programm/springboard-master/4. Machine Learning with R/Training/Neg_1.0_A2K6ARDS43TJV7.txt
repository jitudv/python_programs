The first three books were great.  They moved and I couldn't put them down.  Book four was a disappointment, slow pace and not a thing about DT who was one of the most interesting characters.  "Dances With Dragons" is a disingenuous title...not much DT here either and not much about dragons either.  I had anticipated this book with high hopes only to be sorely disappointed and the only thing draggin' was the pace.  If the next one takes years I'm not sure I'll remember to read it.
