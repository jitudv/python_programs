By this book I'm skimming most of it because it's more description description description - for a tv series to make sure the set and costumes look perfect??? Good grief.  There may be closure with some of the stories somewhere but I give up and I'm very sorry I paid for all five books - too bad - book one was great but this has become silly and silly me for not realizing it by book three.
