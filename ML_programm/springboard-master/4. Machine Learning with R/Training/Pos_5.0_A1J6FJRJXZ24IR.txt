From one of the greatest thriller writers of this generation, James Patterson, comes the explosive, eye-popping novel &quot;Along Came a Spider.&quot;I first read this book about five years ago, long before the movie came out (which is actually a horrific depiction of this great thriller). I got interested in Patterson after I read and saw &quot;Kiss the Girls.&quot; I read ACAS and was totally amazed. It was one of the best books from a new author that I'd read in a long time.The novel begins with a serial killer kidnapping two children from an exclusive private school where he teaches. Detective Alex Cross is hired to find the missing kids. This being the first Alex Cross novel, Patterson portrays him amazingly. Cross is the most intelligent, noble, and kind man that has ever existed in fiction. No matter what Alex Cross book you're reading, even if the plot is horrible, you'll enjoy the book just because Cross is in it. He brings so much to the novel, with his excellent detective and psychologist skills to the love he openly shows for his partner, his grandmother, and his two young children - the latter of the three being the most admirable. Reading scenes between Cross and his children is just so touching...or maybe I'm just being too much of a girl. :)Anyway, back to the novel. In the infinite world of psychos in novels, Patterson knows how to creep us out. Gary Soneji, the killer in ACAS, is a frightening and disturbing character that adds all the suspense needed for the novel. He is a smart killer obsessed with committing the crime of the century.&quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; will send chills through the reader's body and keep their eyes open, alert and glued to each page until all hours of the morning. It is solid, compelling psychological thriller.
