An excellent, action packed, fast paced look at the Norsemen of the eleventh century. Excellent characters and good story really make this world come alive. The book is surprisingly funny, as our hero adopts and discards Islam to later become a rather unorthodox Christian. This time period was fairly unique, as several different cultures clashed all over Europe as the Moors of Spain, Byzantium, The Kievan Rus, the Britons, all waxed and waned, with gangs of rowdy Norsemen going a-viking seemingly everywhere.This is an interesting and entertaining look at a unique culture in a unique time, and is highly recommended.
