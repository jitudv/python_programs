Sara Gruen seems like a nice person. But this novel is total dreck. The structure reeks of baloney, the "different" characters are written with the same bland voice, and the whole melodramatic mess never rises above laughable soap operatics. I'd never want to take enjoyment of this kind of thing away from anyone, but if you've not read it, I'm sure there are better books about the circus out there for you.
