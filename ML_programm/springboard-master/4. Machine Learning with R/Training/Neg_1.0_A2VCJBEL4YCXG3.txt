After several recommendations I picked up this book. More than one of the reviews on here mentions 'Smartly written' and 'Supurb' I question where their bar of judgement is. 3 prime examples (there are many more) are:1- This serial killer did his first job at 12. Later in the book it refers back to this (from the killer's perspective/POV) and he is looking back on it SIXTY years ago. Simple math (apparently not done by the editors, writer, or any praiseworthy readers) puts our serial killer at 72 years old. And this 72 year old man bests kids at video games and kills an FBI agent with a knife in hand combat? -Get real.2- Yeah, we get it, Alex Cross is black. Does it really need to be mentioned on every single page? Was race the major motivator in this story? Seems like it was more of a focus than plot. Does it really matter what race he is?3- No matter how good Alex Cross might be at his job, a detective mouthing off to the police chief and the *Mayor* keeps his job and is allowed to say things like F__ you to his superiors? Unrealistic!New York Times Bestseller... about as realistic as the Academy Awards has become.
