This book should have been called A Dance With Nothing. Because &#34;Nothing&#34; is exactly what happens. The author flat-out admits in the forward that this book is nothing but clippings from the cutting floor of the last book. And man does it show. I can't actually give you spoilers because there aren't any. And most ironically? The dragons aren't even in the book, except for maybe four pages!Here's a summary the action in book 5:48 pages of random conversation that doesn't relate to anything.One sentence description of somebody getting killed.^^ repeat about 20 times.Seriously, there's a chapter called &#34;Dude on a Horse.&#34;The magic has really gone out of this series for me. I hope the next book is a million times better than this!
