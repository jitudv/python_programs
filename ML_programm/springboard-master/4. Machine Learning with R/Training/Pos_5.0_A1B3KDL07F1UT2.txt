I loved this book and did not want it to end. I had read all the negative reviews and considered not getting it - but the price was right, so I did. I am very glad that I did. My only complaint is that I wanted a MAP to show where he went. I could figure out some of the places, but not the Scandinavian/Baltic ones.
