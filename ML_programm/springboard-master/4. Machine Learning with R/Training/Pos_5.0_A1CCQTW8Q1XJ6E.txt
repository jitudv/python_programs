Amazing book and tv series. This book is a little bit review but also gets into what else will happen after where the series ended last season. I look forward to the next book(s) and to see how this all turns out. Who will end up ruling from the iron throne? I am rooting for the Mother of Dragons. I bought the hardback and it is BIG.
