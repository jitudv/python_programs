I read a lot of English historical fiction.  I was really surprised to see all the good reviews for this book.  I thought much of it was boring, hard to read, very contrived and unrealistic.  Also there is a disturbing amount of abuse of the heroine, including multiple rapes - and the heroine keeps going back for more.  SPIOLERS ALERT:  At least four characters (Sam/William and Nick/John)are violently abusive to the main character.The only interesting thing about it for me was the look at the life of Moll Wallbe.  I could barely get through this book and was glad when it was over.
