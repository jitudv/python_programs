This is my all-time favorite Fantasy series.  I was 12 years old when I first started reading these books; and I say "started" because I continued to read them over and over from then on.  When it comes to books, I have few other loves besides Fantasy, so believe me when I say, I've read my share.  This story is passionate, adventurous, magical, and exquisitely heartbreaking.  Though admittedly this first book is not the best of the three.  It is more of a stage setter for the all-important books 2 and 3.  I also must admit that it can be a bit confusing in the begining, mostly because it is written in the hight of emotion and the writer clearly already knew everything that was going to happen when he started, whereas we the reader do not have a clue.  But it is adoringly written, and you will find yourself quickly falling in love with various characters all too easily.I grew to love each of the characters as though they were people I truly knew and felt concern and admiration for.  The center focus being around 5 university students who suddenly find themselves swept up in a cause far bigger than anything they could have imagined.  The fate of the world (and many more worlds, as they quickly learn) lies in the balance as an epic battle begins on the first of all worlds, Fionava.  Kevin, Paul, Kim, Jennifer, and Dave soon dicover who they really are and what their lives have been heading towards since the day they were born.  They are accompanied by many colorful characters, each with a story of their own and an important role to play in the fate of Fionavar.The picture painted by Kay is one of beauty and emotion, with fastinating mythology and detailed character depth.  To quote another of my favorite books (the Princess Bride), "it has fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love," and a few welcome additions such as magic, Gods, and legends.I was passed this book by my mother, and I quickly passed it on to all my closest friends, to which it easily became their favorite fantasy series as well.  You will laugh, and cry, and certainly cheer, long before the end of book 3.  I promise.
