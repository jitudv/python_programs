I would put this novel up there in my top two or three picks. If you really want an interesting view of King Henry the Eighth and his wives from a new perspective, read this book. It hooks you right away and never lets up. I didn't want to do anything but read till I finished the story, and the details are still so fresh in my head even though I read the book two years ago.The movie was surprisingly well done, though, understandably, much was left out. The character of the mother was also different.I highly recommend this novel.
