I didn't finish this book.  I usually love this kind of book.  I got tired of all the Indian Jargon.  Yes, it has a glossary, but many of the words weren't even there.  There were references to things never explained.  It was like I came in on a movie in the middle.  The narrative was just not enough to keep going.
