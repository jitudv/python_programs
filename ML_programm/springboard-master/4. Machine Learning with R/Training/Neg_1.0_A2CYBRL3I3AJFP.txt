I read this expecting something enjoyable.  That was my mistake.  I'm all for books that have no purpose other than to entertain, but the Cross character seems arbitrarily black, like that, by definition, gives him a personality; I didn't buy any of the rest of it, either.  I think a book is cheating when the only reason you're reading it is because you want to know what happens not because you care, but because it would irritate you not to know.  This book cheats.  Bigtime.  I recommend Ridley Pearson or Richard North Patterson if you want something in the genre that's at least decent.  I would have given it no stars, but they wouldn't let me.
