The last two books were just flat out, plain old horrible.  After reading the previous book, (and, actually, I'd started this at the end of the that book), with this book I had gotten unbelievably bored with the series, and would read the first two pages of every chapter, and, if it didn't grip me, i'd skip to the next chapter (I love my kindle and ability to quickly do that).  You would think that this would lead me to ending up at chapters where I didn't know what was going on.  Amazingly enough, that never happened!  Apparently, NOTHING happened in this book.....
