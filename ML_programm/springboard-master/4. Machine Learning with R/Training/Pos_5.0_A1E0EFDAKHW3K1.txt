This is truly a well written book. The author let's you clearly see a very frail old man, his present hospital-like surroundings including the nursing staff and other elderly people in this assisted living facility.The author is clever enough to break up the terrible animal and human cruelties and sadness of the early 1930's era, the circus itself and the indignities some humans endured by inserting enough humor and back flashes to keep the reader from getting very depressed.This is not a pretty story, but it certainly reminds me of the era, which I am old enough to remember, not from a circus life, but from the life of a very poor, homeless family.The author took me back to places I have not been in several decades. I can smell the circus animals, see the uppity "performers" as well as the horrible "tents", the freaks and the laborers who set up and take down the tents.  I can visualise from the words of Sara Gruen, the trains in which many circus people travelled. Oh, yes, believe it or not as a little child, but old enough to remember, this is a mode of travel I recall vividly.I have put Sara Gruen's other books on my Amazon wish list and if I don't receive them as gifts I will eventually buy them for myself.  Her written words come close to looking at old photograps in her novel "Water for Elephants".
