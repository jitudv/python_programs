For some really good and easy recipes this is the book for you. The only drawback to the book is that there is no nutritional information after each recipe.If this is a must for yiu, then skip the book.For me, it was not a deal nreaker, I lost my original copy and was happy to see that it was still in print ! I enjoy cooking meals from this book, as does  my family !
