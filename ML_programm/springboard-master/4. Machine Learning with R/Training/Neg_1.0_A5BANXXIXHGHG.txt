While reading the first 4 books in A Song of Ice and Fire Series, I just couldn't put them down. But while reading a Dance With Dragons, I have to make myself read in order to finish the book.The book has too many pointless descriptions of places, clothes and food. There are also too many pointless dialogues and things who could have been told in one chapter, takes 3 or 4. Besides that, something rarely happens.
