If you thought GRRM would redeem himself for the  A Feast for Crows snooze-fest, well, you were wrong. Rather than bringing the old GRRM to the game, he continued his decline in A Dance with Dragons.Taking the characters that were not in AFfC and a few new ones, he puts them to the same wandering that bored you before. Please feel free to:a.) not buy this book because it contributes almost nothing to the plot, orb.) feel cheated by another GRRM rip-off.If you are addicted to uncomfortable sex scenes, diarrhea and/or menus . . . well, you won't be too disappointed.
