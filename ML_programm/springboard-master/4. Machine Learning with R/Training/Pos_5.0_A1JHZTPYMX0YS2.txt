I have read some of Nouwen's work before, and this is one of his best.  My daughter spoke of this book as she was reading it for a study she was doing at the Christian school where she works, and I bought a copy as she was using hers.  In the middle section, while speaking to everyone, he addresses parents, teachers, and professionals.  I'd say more, but you really need to read it yourself.  This is a book that, read carefully, has the potential to change how you function as a result of your faith.
