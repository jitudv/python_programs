Donaldson is best  known for his work on Fantasy, but this Sci Fi epic kept me on the edge of my seat. the 5 book series ending with This Day all Gods Die is simply tremendous. It is a page turner, and makes you feel anger through most of it. The "Heroes' are mostly vile, the victim shows tremendous strength. It is so complex and real feeling. truly terrific.
