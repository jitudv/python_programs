I really wish publishers would rate books like they do movies.  I got to the porn part and once again threw another book in the trash unfinished.  Problem is these books are good and the authors don't need to put the trashy parts in - they choose to.  Garbage in - Garbage out.  Guard your heart and your mind don't buy this book. Buy something else or wait for the PG version.
