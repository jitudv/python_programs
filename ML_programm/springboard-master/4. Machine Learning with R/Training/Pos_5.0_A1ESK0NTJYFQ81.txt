I was surprised on how much I liked this book.  Once I started, I could not put it down.  Loved the story from the lead male characters perspective. The detail was so good, I could envision the Circus environment like I was there.  The story was both sad and funny and had several good supporting characters. I can definately see Reese Witherspoon in the movie as the female lead.  Great Reading!!
