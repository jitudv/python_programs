I would give all the previous books in the series at least a 4 or higher, and each one left me anticipating the next book.  But this book has completely destroyed any interest I have in finding out what happens next in the series.  This book goes absolutely NOWHERE interesting.  It is like packing to go on a road trip, but spending the entire trip going around in circles in a parking lot.  Other reviewers have commented on the excessive details; I don't mind details if they add something to the story, but too often the details just seem like filler (was GRRM getting paid by the word?). Too much time was spent on what the chracters ate, or what they wore (I'm talking about you, Dany), and not enough time on what they thought or felt. I kept waiting for something to happen, and everytime the story looked as though it were going to pick up steam (see Reek), it fizzled out like wet firecrackers. The other 4 books kept me up at night reading until the wee hours of the morning, this one put me to sleep.
