This book contains a Monty Python and the Holy Grail reference on page 325 of the hardcover. That's about all you need to know about the "quality" of this entry into the series.If you want just a bit more, know that an entire plotline contained in the book (4 chapters or so) could have been excised and reinserted at the end in a couple of paragraphs.Marginally better than AFFC, but only because there's no Samwell Tarly. As hard as the characters try to get stuff accomplished, nothing really happens.
