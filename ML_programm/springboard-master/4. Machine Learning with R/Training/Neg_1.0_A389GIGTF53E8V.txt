I have the paperback edition, published in 2008 by PM Press.  While I am more than sympathetic that it was printed by the "Employee Owners of Thomson-Shore in Dexter, Michigan", I have to say that the point size of the text is making my life miserable.  I try to keep my mind on the ideas expressed on the pages, but the tiny type size bothers me a great deal.  In addition, on some lines the point size is larger than others and some entire pages are a tad blurry.  I don't know if I have a copy from a bad print run or what, but it is really annoying and I don't think that I'll be able to finish the book.  The point size appears to be 8 and quoted text is 6, so it is quite small.  I have 20-20 corrected vision, but this is asking too much.  I may inquire of the publisher.  I wouldn't recommend buying this particular edition - if there is a hardcover edition with larger type size, I'd go with that edition. I'm giving the book a single star, simply because of its readability.  Perhaps that is not fair, but it is the only way I know of to draw attention to the serious defect of this edition.
