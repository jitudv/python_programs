I've never much of a fantasy fan beyond Tolkein and the The Once and Future King. But one episode of the series had me hooked and I couldn't wait to immerse myself in the books. I raced through the first four, then had to wait a good while for this one. But oh, my, it was certainly worth it.I've never seen an author who could juggle such a mega-cast of characters and narrative threads and keep the whole thing comprehensible in drop dead exciting. Not only are the existing characters sent off in some very different directions;  there a host of new characters and places -- including one young man (who shall remain nameless in this review) who has attracted the loyalty of some surprising people and whose plans could be devastating to this entire world from Westeros to the Slave cities to the Wall -- that is if he can just stay alive that long.I hope I won't be a spoiler by saying that this book, according to the author, is not the last to come in this magnificent series. Part of me was looking forward to closure (and the chance to get some long-delayed work done), but I must confess to being glad that there will be at least one more chance to immerse myself in this wonderful, horribly bloody and richly realized world.
