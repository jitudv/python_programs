I have read a bunch of novels recently that kept me engrossed for the first 70-80% and then faded badly. Water for Elephants is worth reading right to the satisfying ending. It is very well paced and has interesting twists and all the characters seemed real to me.I had never considered the 1930's touring circus as a basis for writing a novel. Now I want to learn more about it. That's because Gruen does such a nice job describing it. The characters (and the animals!) are very human and I think she captures the time they lived in quite well. I am impressed that there are over 1000 reviews and still more coming for a book that's been out now for over 4 years. It speaks to some of the universal qualities that appealed to me and perhaps other readers. The lead character is interesting, he's human and he has reflected on a life well lead while  yearning for more. I see a little bit of my father in there!One thing I am always looking for is how well a writer can give voice to a character that is so different from him or herself. Ms Gruen as a modern woman writing in the first person a man in the 1930's does very well in making Jacob a believable character. The writing is tight, swift and it was a pleasure to read.
