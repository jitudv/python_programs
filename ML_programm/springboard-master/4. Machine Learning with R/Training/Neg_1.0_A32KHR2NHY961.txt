There are two specific reasons I rate this novel so low on the scale. First it is very long, tedious and at times laughable as far as plot and story line go. The characters are often cliche and difficult to take seriously and the scenes tend to be forced and come off as phony at best. Not present is the pins and needels descriptive narrative Clancy is so well known for. There are dozens of mistakes and errors and at times the plot gets away only to come back with an anti-climatic closure or worse, a very predictable one.Secondly without going as far as accusing Mr. Clancy of plagiarism, I will go as far as saying this story virtually mirrors that of Mack Bolan, the Executioner, written by Don Pendleton nearly 30 years ago. This is the story of the mysterious Mr. Clark who has so often come to the aid of Clancy's favorite protagonist, Jack Ryan. This novel is a prequel of several others in the Ryan series and attempts to explain who and what Clark is. Not only does it fail to do so, it takes a bit too much from the original Executioner novel. Worse, it doesn't have the gritty edge of Don pendleton's work and it is obvious it was written many years after the Vietnam war and the etire era it is supposed to depict. There are errors of detail and just plain poor development of the times and characters and their interactions.Read this one at your own risk or read it first to be more impressed with previous and latter offerings. Don'tlet it sour you on Tom Clancy's work. He is a great author, but this particular book is a disservice to his loyal readers.
