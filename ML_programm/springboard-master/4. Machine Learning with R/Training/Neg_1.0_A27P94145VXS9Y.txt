The prologue to this book put me off a little, containing as it did a very descriptive act of violence, but I persevered since someone had recommended this book to me.  Two more very ugly, explicit and disgusting sexualized "scenes" in the very early pages had me deleting the whole thing and not reading any further.  I'm told this has been made into a movie, which not only beggars belief, but illustrates why I rarely find a movie these days that is worth watching.
