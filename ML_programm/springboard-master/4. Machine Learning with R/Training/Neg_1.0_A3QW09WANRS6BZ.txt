I am an ardent student of history and particularly enjoy English and Scottish history from the period 1300-1750.  The author of this work is one of my favorites, having read most of his Flashman novels of historical fiction.  That being the case, you would think that this work would be right in my wheelhouse.  You would be wrong.Expecting interesting stories and histories of events along the English/Scottish border, I was instead confronted with a dry, turgid scholarly treatise.  Endless citing of English and Scottish village names, multiple variations of spellings and name forms, many times for the same person, illegible maps and a complete lack of any semblance of organization leaves me mystified how on earth this book has garnered so many positive ratings.  Does the author have so many relatives?Most annoying is the author's frequently employed tendency of directly quoting many of the actors in the history.  You would think this would bring an authenticity and clarity to the dialogue, but quite the opposite.  For you see, the denizens of the border didn't exactly speak the King's English as you and I know it.  For a good example, read some Robert Burns and explain to me what it says.  Page after page of quotations whose meaning can only be vaguely discerned by puzzling over context and possible meanings of words spelled only slightly similar to those with which you are familiar.  Loads of enjoyment and enlightenment ensue.This is, quite frankly, one of the worst books I have ever read.
