I won't wax philosophical and in great detail as to why this was a disappointment; too many others have done it much more eloquently than I could. Not only did I buy the ADwD book, I downloaded the Kindle version so I'd never be without it until I finished it.  Never again.  If GRRM ever does release another installment, I'll come here and get the Cliff Notes and read the reviews before depositing another penny on this series. I thought perhaps AFfC was an abberation and surely this one would make up for it.Let me also add that I'm a very forgiving person for authors regarding timelines for releasing books and the occasional story dragging a bit. When I decide to buy a particular author or series, I buy and collect them all. So for me to give this highly-anticipated book 2 stars and to feel strongly enough to voice my disappointment is a rarity. I'd have given it one star, but I really like the cover and it looks good in my library. Just so.
