I preordered the book on my kindle and hoped for the best, but was sorry I bought it. Even middle books in a series require introduction, development and conclusion, but ADWD left you with no resolution at all! People complain about "cliffhangers", but they are not even cliffhangers; plotlines just end and leave you nowhere. And what's with the title?  A Dance with Dragons? The dragons did absolutely nothing until the very end, and I certainly wouldn't call that a dance. The Meereen chapters were the worst: long exposition about people and politics I didn't give a fig about, endless inconsequential new characters, and Dany devolves from a strong queen to a dumb, lovesick teenager. Tyrion has lost his cutting wit and goes on a long, meandering river cruise getting nowhere. Everyone in the East was heading toward Dany, but no-one (except Quenton!) arrived. The best chapters were the ones in the North. If Martin had continued those plotlines until after the battle, we would have gotten a conclusion and been eager for the next stage. Too bad he has a fangirl editor; a good edit was what AFFC and ADWD really needed.
