This review is not about the book, story or author - I regret buying this book on the Kindle without Text to Speech. I am a busy reader that needs to keep a story going during my commute when I can't read - and then pick up reading when I have a break - publishers should be more concerned about selling books than limiting the medium of my unabridged consumption.
