A few months ago when I started this series I was sure this set would be something I wanted on my bookshelves.  Game of Thrones was definitely a five star book in my opinion, but the books have been slowly deteriorating, A Feast for the Crows was decent, but A Dance with Dragons has been such a slow read.There are too many points of view, I feel detached from most of the characters because there are so many, I am also a little paranoid to get too attached to any character, I feel like the author could kill them off at any moment.Okay, now I just want to rant.  I thought all of Westeros would have had to come together by now to battle the Others or Whites or whatever the boogeyman in the north is. Is that going to be the eventual progression?  Honestly I think that with how slow the author has become about putting the books out he will be dead before anything interesting actually happens.  I mean, how many years did it take to put out this book, like 5.  I just don't want to invest more time if the next book is going to come out in another 5 years and NOTHING will happen!Did anyone else feel like George must have been hungry or eating himself as he wrote this, there seemed to be a lot of discussion about food in this book.
