I think this was a great book. It is almost like getting two books for the price of one. The current day cast has a past that ties them together 800 years ago. It was very well written and slid from present to past and back smoothly. I think the whole story was good. I read it day after day and carried my kindle around with me like I used to carry a book to the table at dinner when I was a kid. If you enjoy stories of the past and a good love story then this is a good choice.
