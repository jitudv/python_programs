Halfway through and I can go on no longer. Nothing has happened and judging from other reviews nothing continues to happen. The breaking point for me was one too many pages of useless whining from some female dwarf that Tyrion meets; yes, another throwaway minor character that GRRM seems strangely fascinated by. Sadly, I don't share his fascination, and no longer care about this series, which has degenerated into a strange combination of travelogue, torture porn, and food criticism.
