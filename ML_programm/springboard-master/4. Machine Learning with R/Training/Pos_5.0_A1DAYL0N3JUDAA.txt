The Silk Vendetta is one of Victoria Holt's best books. Mixing intrigue, mystery, romance and suspense, she weaves a compelling tale round the heroine Lenore, who grows up at The Silk House. The background of the silk trade is engrossing, and Lenore's character is compelling as she deals with the two men in her life, Philip - likeable and kindhearted- and Charles, as cruel as he is handsome. But as always with Victoria Holt, all is not as it seems, and Lenore has to go through a succession of adventures before finding true love. If you like your romances sevred up with plenty of adventure, then read this book. If you've read other Victoria Holt books then you'll know what I mean, and if you haven't, you're in for a treat.
