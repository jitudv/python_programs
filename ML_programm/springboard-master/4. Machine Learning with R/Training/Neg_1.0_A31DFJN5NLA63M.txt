Nothing happens and those things that do happen just piss you off... the book go no where and once you hit the last 5 chapters you want to throw it out the window becuase of what happens to a certain character...I loved all the other books, this one just dragged its feet and dissapoints severally.Not sure if I even want to purchase the last 2 in the series when they appear in 2035~ only took what 5 years for this one..../rant
