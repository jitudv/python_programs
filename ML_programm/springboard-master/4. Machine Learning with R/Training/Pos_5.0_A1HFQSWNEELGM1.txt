When I first saw the description of the book, i was not convinced it was something i wanted to read, it took me days to decide and i am glad i took the chance. The book takes you back into the time of kings, barons and earls but at the same time makes you grip on to the modern world. The author does not waste the readers time by using run on sentences or place unnecessary information into the book.The writer takes you on a roller coaster ride of emmotions from the view of three main chracters but also introducing the roles of other persons in the book to help bring about the story. You know it is a good book when you want to start and figure out for your self what is happeneing and you know it is awesome when even in your dreams you want to know what the end results going to be. I was really happy i got this book even though i usually stick to paranoumal book. High praises to the writer, fantastically written. I recommended it to all my friends.
