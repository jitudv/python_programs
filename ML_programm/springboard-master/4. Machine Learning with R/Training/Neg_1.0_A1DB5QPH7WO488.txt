Clearly George Martin is being paid by the word.What else could account for a 1000-page novel, with more emphasis on describing food, clothing, hairstyles, scenery, and the genealogy of every plant the allegedly-main characters traipse by, on their slog from nowhere (the location the plot reached at the end of A Feast for Crows) to nowhere (the plot's final resting place)?The edition of A Feast for Crows that I read (from Amazon's box set of the first four novels) included an apology for that novel's lack of focus and plot development, with a promise that A Dance with Dragons would make up for it.  Consider that promise well and truly broken.Rather than plot advancement, we get a second helping of Feast's emphasis on who wore what, the trivialities on which they pondered as the trudge through exhaustively-described scenery, and a glutton's enthusiastic recounting of every dish at every meal, what it looked, smelled and tasted like, where the ingredients came from and how they were prepared, ad infinitum.  One suspects that the author was perpetually hungry while writing--and perhaps should have scheduled his time at the typewriter _after_ his meals, instead of before them.There's also the (now-formulaic) build-up of some character's plans, his surmounting obstacle after obstacle, drawing ever-nearer to success, and then -BOOM- death from out of nowhere.  Gratuitously killing off main characters just for the shock value ceased to entertain after about book 2.I'm grateful that I hadn't spent much time waiting for the release of this book, having been introduced to the series by HBO and having read all five in quick succession.  If I were one of the unlucky early-adopters who waited for years and years to get book 4 and then book 5, I might well be organizing some sort of sit-in protest at Bantam, until they agreed to handcuff no less than two rigorous editors to the author from now until the series is completed.As it is, I am unlikely to buy any further books in the series; I'll simply wait until others have bought, read, and been disappointed by them, and then borrow their copies.
