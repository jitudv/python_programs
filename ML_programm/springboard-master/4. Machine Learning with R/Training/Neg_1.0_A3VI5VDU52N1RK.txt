I must confess that I really enjoyed the first three books of this series. I was disappointed with this book as well as its predecessor. They were mostly filler and history lessons. I kept reading this book because I was attached to Snow (The only main character with a sense of honor). After I finished it I regretted deeply the hours of my life that were wasted on book that didn't deserve them. This book feels more like a horror flick: crude and pointless violence with no depth.
