This is so much better than A Song for Arbonne.It has more magic ,less pointless stuff,and it's much more interesting.The first say ,one hundred and sixty pages are world development,but as soon as things get exciting,you're in for a treat.I can not wait till my order for The Wandering Fire and The Darkest Road come in.The ending really left me out on a limb.Anyone who likes detail is sure to like this.There is detail not only on the plot,but on the races,the history,the characters.This has every creature a fantasy lover can ask for.Lios alfar(light elves),Svart alfar(dark elves),dwarves,wolves that stand on their hind feet,a hand of fire that splits a mountain apart,seers,mages,urgachs,eltors,just about everything.In case you hate books that are poorly edited,this book is considerably more well edited than most Roc books.Kimberly,Kevin,Jeniffer,Paul,and Dave are transported by the mage Loren Sivercloak and his source Matt Soren to the world of Fionavar.Things are beginning well,Kimberly is learning to be a seer,Kevin and Paul are traveling with Prince Diarmuid ,but as soon as Jennifer is captured,Rakoth Maugrim becomes free from the mountain in which he was chained.Danger is ahead.
