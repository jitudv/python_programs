...then read something great like War and Peace.This is worse than a steaming pile of you know what - it is a long steaming pile of you know what.  The smell stays with you long after you've finished it.Like others have said, I loved the first 3 books.  Then, AFFC was terrible.  I didn't know if anything else could be quite as bad, but now this might be even worse.I'm done with the series.  There are a million great books out there waiting to be read.
