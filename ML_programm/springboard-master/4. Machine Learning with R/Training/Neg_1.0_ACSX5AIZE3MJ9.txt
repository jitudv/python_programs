this book taught me not to start series of books until the last one is published.when (i mean if) the series is complete, i will pick it up again (or wait for hbo to finish it?).i think, not sure, this book is longer than all of the lord of the rings books combined, yet NOTHING happens (well enough happens that a 1 page summary can easily suffice, i've seen it done in reviews here).sad to see the greatness of books 1-3 diminish...
