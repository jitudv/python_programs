Boring is far too nice a word for this misadventure by author Hill.  The plot is so convoluted, the development so slow, the logic so absent, that the publishers should issue a recall on this, collect all remaining volumes, and burn them.  Someof the Dalziel stories are quite catching, but this one, as another reviewer has said, can put you to sleep no matter how inflicted with insomnia you are.  Skip it.
