I'm giving this one star because after waiting years for the story to pick up again.  This book was more disappointing than the last.  It didn't go anywhere.  In the end we're basically where were with these dragons before the book.  It was more plots more characters, boring, slow, and hard to finish.Hard to finish is the least horrible thing I can say.  I bought this book on pre order years ago.  So I got it as soon as it came out.  I just finished it yesterday.  I've read at least a dozen books since starting this book.  I finally resolved to finish it, and with that decided that this series is done for me.
