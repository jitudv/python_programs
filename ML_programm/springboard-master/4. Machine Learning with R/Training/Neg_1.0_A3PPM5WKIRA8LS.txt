I read this book years ago, must have been not long after it first came out.  I remembered really liking it and looked forward to re-reading it.  What a difference on the second reading!  The male/female relationships are so dated. The violence and abuse against Jo are horrible, and her taking it and going back to her rapist over and over are appalling.  The characterizatons are two dimensional, and the writing is melodramatic and ridiculous.  I'm quite frankly ashamed of my younger self for liking it so much.  There are much better "past life" novels out there; " The Winter Sea" by Susanna Kearsley is one that I recently read and thought quite good. I would stay away from this one.
