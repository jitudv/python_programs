It is not that the book is bad per-say it is just full of frivolous side plots, useless ponderings, and pointless details. This would be tolerable if he published one of these a year, but he doesn't. The end effect is you wait five years for half a story that is 950 pages long. Every story line ended with a cliff hanger and no resolution was reached for anyone or anything. It was like he got tired of writing with 50 pages to go and said "f*** it, they can find out in the next book". I suppose we will now need to wait another five years to find out who lives and who dies (2 different characters), which army wins the battle (3 different armies), and if the lost characters return (1 character). For those of you keeping track at home that is 6 story lines that were left as cliff hangers.I genuinely liked this series, at first. But each book seems to get worse. Not that the plot is bad, or the characters aren't compelling, but to get to those gems you have to wade through pages and pages of drivel. Mr. Martin, please, I beg you, by the old gods and the new, hire a good editor and heed their advice.
