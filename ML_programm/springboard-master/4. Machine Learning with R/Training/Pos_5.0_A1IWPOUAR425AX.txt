Having fallen in love with Showtime's The Tudors, I've been slightly addicted to historical fiction from the time of Henry the Eighth recently. This book was a great read and I was sad when it ended. The author's style was straightforward and descriptive without being overly flowery. I will read more by this author, Phillipa Gregory!
