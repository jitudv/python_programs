Loved this book. Though the ending is telegraphed ahead of the final chapter, the book is satisfying and fun.I played in a circus band when I was a teenager and am delighted by the author's accurate feel for circuses and descriptions of circus folks and traditions.Sara Gruen writes well. The story is solid. A very good book.
