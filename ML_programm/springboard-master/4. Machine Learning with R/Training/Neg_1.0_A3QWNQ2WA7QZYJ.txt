The best part of this book is probably unintentional on Clancy's part.  Jack Ryan succumbs to the seduction of power and turns into a sleazy  politician.Throughout the seven Jack Ryan books, Jack has developed into  a one dimensional superhero.  By this book, his character is as thin and  flat as a piece of cardboard.  Throughout this book, he is the perfect,  honest polictical outsider, single handedly cleaning up the American  political system.  The whole time he insists he doesn't want the job.  But,  at the end of the book, once Ryan feels the power of kicking the butts of  the liberal opposition and of the Iraqis, he changes his mind and says he  will stay in office.  Ryan turns into the lying, two-faced politician he  said he hated.Besides the ending, this is mostly a miserable book. The  first 400 pages are boring and repetitive.  There some really good parts in  the middle where all these intricate subplots get going.  But most of these  subplots go nowhere or are left dangling.  There's an exciting little war  at the end, but it not enough to make up for the 1100 other pages that go  nowhere.There are some minor problems with most of Clancy's other books,  but for the most part they are very good, exciting and entertaining.  This  book is a complete shock.  It will be interesting to see if he can recover  with the next book in the series, which was just released.
