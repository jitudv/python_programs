I loved the first three books, but four and five are basically 2000 pages of nothing.  It is clear that Martin is milking the story and has absically abandonded anything resembling a plot now that he can start collecting HBO royalities and stretch this out as long as possible.  The books read like a soap opera and moves just about as fast.  To be honest there are about 400 pages of intersting, well written, story telling embedded in the almost 2000 pages of books four and five.  Good luck inding them.
