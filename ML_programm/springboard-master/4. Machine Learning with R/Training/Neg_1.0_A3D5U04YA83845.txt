While I usually love Agatha Christie, I found this novel rather dull and quite disappointing. It wasn't the typical body-at-the-start book, where a mystery must be solved, and that may be part of the reason I didn't enjoy it as much; in addition, the twist seemed to come on... a bit too fast. I felt like I knew the twist, but only because (I think?) I may have seen the movie version of the book at one time or another -- clearly it was unmemorable, if I had seen it.In all, I suggest you steer clear. The first part was fun, but the majority wasn't, and the end did not make up for it.
