The first three books in this series are fantastic.  I loved every word.  The fourth, I struggled with...and was very frustrated when NOTHING happened!This was the same.  So much was packed into the first three books, and these last two could have been shrunk to a single chapter each.I won't buy any more in this series....I'm moving on
