This book - and the rest of the Farseer Trilogy - has all the qualities of the Assassin Trilogy - and then it's even better! The characters are vivid and stunningly described - all seem to come to life from the first page, but believe me, you do not know them before you finish the last page of book three. Hobb has gained a fantastic ability in making her characters realistic, and noone in these books are only good or evil - the stark black and white of the Assassin Trilogy - in these books, the characters change and develop, and those you first dislike might end up being those you admire the most - and vice versa.I can't wait for book three of the Tawny Man trilogy to be released - cause I won't torture myself by beginning on those books before I can read it all in one go! Once you've started, there's no letting go!
