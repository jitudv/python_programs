Wow!  This was painful to listen to.  Roy Dotrice may have a wonderful speaking voice but his reading of Martin's work was excruciating to endure.I've no idea where or why he got the idea that all of Martin's characters were either Scotish Highlanders or Cockney Louts - with the occasional poorly done Sydney Greenstreet imitation thrown in for good measure - but that's about all that populate his rendering.  As if that didn't rankle enough, the man vocalized _all_ the women - and I do mean _all_ the women - as 14th century Irish tavern wenches.  Even if they weren't smallfolk in the tale.Had this been my first exposure to what Martin created then I'd have gone no further with it and stayed away from the rest in disgust.You would think that as successful as Martin has been with this series that they would've gotten a more capable and fitting reader for his works.I hope they do so in the future as Dotrice is really an awful choice here.
