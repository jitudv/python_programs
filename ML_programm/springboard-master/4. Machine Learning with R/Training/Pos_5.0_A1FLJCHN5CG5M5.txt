Excellent book, well written, wonderful progression.  I've read a number of her books and been delighted by them.Two more words required as the Amazon software writers must be inept or remedial to not be able to write software that allows one to just say &#34;wow&#34; and let it go at that.  Seems like when Amazon comes hat in hand begging for a review, using my time they would make it easy for me as the writer instead of mandating this or that.But maybe like the two dollars they stole from me via their audio department.  The audio book did not work they kept my money, customer service is non existent but that may require English speaking people.
