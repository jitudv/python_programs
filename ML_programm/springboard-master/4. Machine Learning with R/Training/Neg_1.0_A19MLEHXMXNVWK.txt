...This is not a good book. ...Simply because its not well written, was a least 100 pages too long for the story, contained no characters about which anyone could be reasonably sympathetic and had no focus.Part courtroom drama, part ghost story, the plot of Lost Girls never really finds a focus.  It shifts from a murder trial, in which the main character is the defense attorney, to ghost story to urban legend.  The main character himself is sleazy, unlikable and incompetent and I gave up on finding anything redeeming about him after the first 50 pages.  That said, its difficult to care what happens to him.  The "lady in the lake" legend is an element that never pans out for Pyper and shouldn't have made it past the editor.  It merely adds static to an already precarious plot.Overall, its obvious that this was a first novel and it makes a good case for the use of editors.  Sentence fragments and passive voice abound.  If the story itself was better, it would be easier to forgive these things but, alas, its not.Leave it sitting on the shelf.  There are better things to read out there.
