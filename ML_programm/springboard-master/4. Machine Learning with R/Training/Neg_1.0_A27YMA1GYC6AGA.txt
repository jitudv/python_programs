The worst book I have read in ten years.Over priced, over hyped.Two thirds of this book should have been edited and left on the floor.This is the best that Mr. Martin can do after 6 years? If so, please let it be the last.This was one of the most eagerly awaited books in years and a major flop.The book like the last couple he has wrote was hard to read.The reader must be committed to the story, devote endless hours to the book for NO ending.Way, way, way, to many twists and turns,to many people, places, things,that have to be remembered.Mr Martin, it does not need 50 pages on how a spoon looks or another 30 on how the person raised it to his mouth to eat. Not to mention that is ok to leave some of the good guys alive.I don't mind killing off the main subject from time to time but you have pushed this to the limit. I have purchased his other 4 books and was ok with them, some better then others.This is my last book that I intend to buy from him.
