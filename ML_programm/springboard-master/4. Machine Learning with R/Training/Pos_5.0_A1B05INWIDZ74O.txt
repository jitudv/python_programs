Tom Clancy once again writes another great book.  His focus is on one character in this book. So this would be a good book to start with if you have never read Clancy before. If you like his works, this is a must. I  could not put it down. This is a wounderfully developed character. This  could also be titled, &quot;The making of a great agent.&quot;
