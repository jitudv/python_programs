I give up. I can't even finish reading this because it's just too painful to experience the disconnect from the previous books in the series. Nothing much seems to happen, characters argue and talk and eat and travel. When things do happen they don't really seem to make sense. Most chapters involving characters from the first three books just don't ring true in some way.I'm not completely convinced that GRRM actually wrote the majority of this book. It simply doesn't build on what has come before. Old characters spin their wheels while unnecessary new characters pop into existence. The only explanation I can think of is that this book was constructed and edited with future seasons of the TV series in mind.Dance With Dragons feels like it was ghost written by somebody who has no real emotional connection to the old characters. Classic TV plot devices like cliffhangers and reversed deaths are used with abandon. Shocking dramatic events often had a huge emotional impact in the earlier books. But here they just feel like manipulative plot devices for ending a TV episode.It's really quite shocking just how bad this huge, meandering mess of a book is. It's hard for me to imagine anybody giving it a five star review. But, then again, I always underestimate the degree to which people become emotionally invested in works of fiction.My advice is to avoid this book. In fact, don't even start the book series if you haven't already. Just enjoy the HBO TV series. The producers on HBO are likely to keep the plot moving along nicely. Also you are guaranteed to get one new season per year for as long as it runs. In contrast the book series has jumped the rails, hurtled down the ravine and crashed into a great steaming mass of debris.
