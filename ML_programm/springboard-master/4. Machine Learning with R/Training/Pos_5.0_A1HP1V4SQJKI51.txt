One only gets small hints in 'Glittering Images' that there is a lot more  to Jon Darrow than meets the eye, 'Glamourous Powers' is his story. After  leaving his order after seeing a vision, Darrow tries to work out his  vocation and in his attempt lets his ego and spiritual arrogance get the  better of him which leads to tragedy, but also the offer of spiritual  renewal afterwards. An excellent look at how spiritual leaders and mentors  have their own failings and the fact that they also need to be helped and  disiplined. It is an excellent argument against those who are completeley  against charismatic renewal, but also against those who are totally for it  without seeing the warning signs and the need to be answerable to someone  who you trust but who who you also don't have a cosy relationship with.
