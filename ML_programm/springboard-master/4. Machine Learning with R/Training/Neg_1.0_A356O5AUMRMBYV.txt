It's tough being a Tudor lover, especially when you're also a European history major. The trashy movies, TV shows, and novels just don't seem to end.But this piece blew me farther away than most with its incredible levels of sensationalist inaccuracy.Why? When history has provided us with such a vibrant tapestry of dynamic, intriguing characters, real people living real lives, why must we reduce them to soap opera depth and dignity?Ordinarily I wouldn't bother with adding to the voices debating this book; there are plenty of people doing that already. But when I saw this:"I recommend this book and all of the Tudor novels written by Philippa Gregory to anyone who loves true historical fiction."... I had to speak up.To anyone reading: this is NOT TRUE HISTORY! This is trashy, inaccurate drivel! The history of humanity is too deeply thrilling and too important to be obscured by this level of sludge. There is no excuse for this kind of ignorance in the modern age; a quick Internet search can render treasure troves of information like our ancestors could only dream of. Get your historical knowledge from Google, if you like, but not from Gregory.I don't have anything against sensationalist romances. If that floats your boat, great. But I do have issue with the subject I care so passionately for being trampled without apology.So read the book, if you like; enjoy it even. But please, please don't take anything it says to be real history! We deserve to be better informed than this.
