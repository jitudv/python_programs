Ugh: long sections of landscape details with no point, lots of really really minor characters tediously described. Virtually nothing in the way of advancing the plot. Tiresome descriptions of pus, blood, and wounds ad nauseum. Only there for shock value. I loved the first 3 books. 4 and 5 are just plain boring. Won't be buying anymore of this series.
